Please remember that D&D is a vast community. Not all DMs will interpret the rules the same way. Not all DMs will use the same edition, so the rules might not even be the same. The fun of D&D comes from the interaction between the DM and the players. This is just as much your game as it is mine, if not more so.

This Obsidian Vault is an offshoot of the one I made for myself as a DM. As such it reflects my DM philosophy, and I üôè that it will prove useful to you as players. If you decide to play with another DM it *may* be useful, but that was a secondary criteria in my creation of the vault. You also **do not** have to use this vault, though I suggest you do for this one-shot.
