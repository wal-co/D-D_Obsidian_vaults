>[!tip]+ Sneak Attack
>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
>
>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

# Features and Traits

>[!tip]+ Thieves' Cant
>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
>
>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

>[!tip]+ Expertise
>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
>
>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.
>
>- Thieves' Tools
>- Stealth

>[!tip]+ Keen Senses
>You have proficiency in the Perception skill

>[!tip]+ Fey Ancestry
>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep


>[!tip]+ Trance
>Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.


>[!tip]+ Superior Darkvision
>You can see up to $120ft$ in darkness

>[!tip]+ Sunlight Sensitivity
>You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

>[!tip]+ Drow Magic
>You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

>[!tip]+ Drow Weapon Training
>You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.
