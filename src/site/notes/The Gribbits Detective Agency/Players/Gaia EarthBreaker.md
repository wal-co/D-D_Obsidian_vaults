>[!tip]+ Absorb Elements
> Casting Time: 1 reaction
> Range: $Self$
> Components: S
> Duration: 1 Round
> 
>The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra $1d6$ damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.
>

> Range: $Touch$
> Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur wrapped in a cloth)

> 
>You establish a telepathic link with one beast you touch that is friendly to you or charmed by you. The spell fails if the beast’s [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Intelligence Ability Score\|INT]] is $4$ or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains #advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.

On a failed save, a creature takes $1d6$ bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each $5-foot-diameter$ portion requiring at least $1 minute$ to clear by hand.

>You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes $1d10$ piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]] saving throw or take $2d6$ cold damage.
>

On a failed save, a creature takes $2d8$ thunder damage and is pushed $10 feet$ away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
>
> In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed $10 feet$ away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to $300 feet$.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by $1d8$ for each slot level above 1st.
