# Pre-Session Notes

```ad-summary
title: What You Know
collapse: open
You are in the city of Waterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors, where the Artificer Cult has recently released the black dragon Gabu'strath.

Upon waking our detective agency, which is just a small group in the bigger Gribbit's Detective Agency, recieved a small calling card with the Beggar King's mark. After a quick breakfast, the group now finds themselves outside [[The Beggar Court]], a network of sprawling tunnels located underneath the city.

While you were leaving *The Drunk Warrior*, the inn where you got the job tip, you noticed another group that seemed like they were in a rush to get to Waterdeep, so you have a suspicion the overly talkative bartender did not deliver the card to just your group, despite his insistance to that fact.

```

## Things to do before our session
- Come up with a backstory for your character and share it with me (in an [[Using Obsidian/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] note would work!)
- Read through the [[Players Handbook/Player Handbook Wiki\|Player Handbook Wiki]] wiki
- Get comfortable using this software, not just the website.
- Find a picture for your character and send it to me as a link or `.jpg` or `.png`. If you don't you'll be stuck with whatever one I choose for you. 

> [!help] ToDo task to learn how to use obsidian and to test link sharing
><br> 
>>[!warning]
>>This must be done in the Obsidian app, it cannot be done on the webpage! Only the final step is on the webpage!
><br>
> 1) Make a new note in obsidian by pressing `control + n`  in ObsidianMD (read the user guide for help writing new notes).<br><br>Name this note `your name pcloud test`
> 2) In the note, add a Level 1 heading (type `# heading name` for a heading, or use `control + p` to pull up the command pallet and search `heading`), and label it `My character traits`
> 3) Access the player's handbook through the attachments folder or from the Classes page for your character, using the table of contents (You should be able to find this in the top left of the annotation viewer, **do not** use the sidebar icon, even though it looks identical. You may need to select the list view rather than the picture view in this screen) and go to the "Backgrounds" page in chapter 4.
> 4) Find *your* background and roll a dice (or just pick one) for each of the traits (you will only roll one die for each trait, make note of the text)
> 5) Upload the `.md` file back to me using the link at the bottom of this page. (If you don't have obsidian yet for whatever reason, give me a word doc or a `.txt` (preferred))
> <br>
>>[!summary] Picture Below
>>I have given you an example of the sheet in the player handbook as well as an example of what I want back

![Background Example.png](/img/user/Attachments/Images/Background%20Example.png)
- blue = bookmarks button
- green = background
- yellow = first two traits. *You* will do all $4$ traits 

## Example file I want back

```markdown
Corey's pcloud test

# My Character traits

## Personality trait: 
- I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen

## Ideal:
- **Power**: I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy (#Lawful)

## Bond:
- I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parent's died.

## Flaw:
- I judge others harshly, and myself even more severly
