# Pre-Session Notes

```ad-summary
title: What You Know
collapse: open
You are in the city of Waterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors. Your detective agency, the Gribbit's Detective Agency, recieved word of a job in this northern port city, where the Artificer Cult has recently released the black dragon Gabu'strath. 

While you were entering *The Drunk Warrior*, the inn where you got the job tip, you noticed another group that seemed like they were in a rush to get to Waterdeep, so you have a suspicion the overly talkative bartender did not tell just your group about this job, despite his insistance to that fact.

## Things to do before our session
- Come up with a backstory for your character and share it with me (in an [[Using Obsidian/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] note would work!)
- Read through the [[Players Handbook/Player Handbook Wiki\|Player Handbook Wiki]] wiki
- Get comfortable using this software, not just the website.
- Find a picture for your character and send it to me as a link or `.jpg` or `.png`. If you don't you'll be stuck with whatever one I choose for you.
