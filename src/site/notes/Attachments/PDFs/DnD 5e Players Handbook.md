sota and W iscon sin —a group o f friends gathered together to forever alter the history o f gam ing. It w asn ’t their intent to do so. Th ey w ere tired o f m erely readin g tales about w orld s o f m agic, m onsters, and adventure. They w anted to play in th ose w orlds, rather than ob serv e them. That they w ent on to invent D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s , and thereby ignite a revolution in gam ing that continu es to this day, sp eaks to tw o things. First, it sp eak s to their ingenuity and genius in fig­ uring out that gam es w ere the perfect w ay to explore w orld s that could not oth erw ise exist. A lm ost every m od ern gam e, w hether played on a digital device or a tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D. S econ d , it is a testam ent to the inherent appeal o f the gam e they created. D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s sparked a thriving global phenom enon. It is the first roleplaying gam e, and it rem ains one o f the best o f its breed. To play D&D, and to play it w ell, you d on ’t n eed to read all the rules, m em orize every detail o f the gam e, or m aster the fine art o f rolling funny look in g dice. N one o f th ose things have any bea rin g on w hat’s best about the game. W hat you need are tw o things, the first being friends with w h om you can share the gam e. Playing gam es with your friends is a lot o f fun, but D & D d oes som eth in g m ore than entertain. Playing D & D is an exercise in collaborative creation. You and your friends create epic stories filled with ten­ sion and m em orable dram a. You create silly in-jokes that m ake you laugh years later. The dice w ill be cruel to you, but you w ill soldier on. Your collective creativ­ ity w ill build stories that you w ill tell again and again, ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff o f legend. If you d on ’t have friends interested in playing, don ’t w orry. T h ere’s a sp ecia l alchem y that takes place around a D & D table that nothing else can m atch. Play the gam e with som eon e enough, and the tw o o f you are likely to end up friends. It’s a c o o l side effect o f the gam e. Your next gam ing group is as clo se as the nearest g am e store, online forum , or gam ing convention. The se co n d thing you n eed is a lively im agination or, m ore importantly, the w illin gn ess to u se whatever im agination you have. You d on ’t need to be a m aster storyteller or a brilliant artist. You just n eed to aspire to create, to have the cou rage o f som eon e w ho is w illing to build som eth in g and share it w ith others. Luckily, just as D & D can strengthen your friendships, it can help build in you the con fid en ce to create and share. D & D is a gam e that teach es you to lo o k for the clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e a problem , and push y ou rself to im agine w hat cou ld be, rather than sim ply a ccep t what is. T he first characters and adventures you create w ill probably be a collection o f cliches. That’s true o f every­ one, from the greatest D u n geon M asters in history on dow n. A ccep t this reality and m ove on to create the secon d character or adventure, w hich w ill b e better, and then the third, w h ich w ill be better still. R epeat that over the cou rse o f time, and s o o n y ou ’ll be able to create anything, from a ch a ra cter’s backgrou n d story to an epic w orld o f fantasy adventure. O nce you have that skill, it’s y ou rs forever. C ou n tless w riters, artists, and other creators can trace their beg in ­ nings to a few p ages o f D & D notes, a handful o f dice, and a kitchen table. A bove all else, D&D is yours. The friendships you m ake around the table w ill be unique to you. The adven­ tures you em bark on, the characters you create, the m em ories you m ake—th ese w ill be yours. D & D is your p erson al corn er o f the universe, a place w here you have free reign to do as you wish. G o forth now. R ead the rules o f the gam e and the story o f its w orlds, but always rem em ber that you are the one w h o brings them to life. Th ey are nothing w ithout the spark o f life that you give them. M ike M earls M ay 2014 I n t r o d u c t i o n The D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o l e p l a y in g gam e is about storytelling in w orld s o f sw ord s and sorcery. It sh ares elem ents w ith ch ild h ood gam es o f m ake-believe. Like th ose gam es, D & D is driven by im agina­ tion. It’s about picturing the tow ering castle beneath the storm y night sky and im agining h ow a fantasy adventurer m ight react to the challen ges that scen e presents. Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crum bling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm , leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains o f the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors o f Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard. Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues. Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight? Unlike a gam e o f m ake-believe, D & D gives structure to the stories, a w ay o f determ ining the con seq u en ces o f the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve w hether their attacks hit or m iss or w hether their adven­ turers can sca le a cliff, roll away from the strike o f a m agical lightning bolt, or pull o ff som e other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the d ice m ake som e out­ c o m e s m ore probable than others. Dungeon Master (DM): O K, one at a tim e. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles? Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they m ight be creatures and not decorations? DM : Make an Intelligence check. Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply? DM : Sure! Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven. DM : They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge? In the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and team s up with other adventurers (played by friends). W orkin g together, the group might explore a dark dun­ geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost tem ple deep in a ju n gle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a m ysterious m ountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic m onsters, and discover fabulous m agic item s and other treasure. O ne player, however, takes on the role o f the D un geon M aster (D M ), the gam e’s lead storyteller and referee. T h e DM creates adventures for the characters, w h o nav­ igate its h azards and d ecide w hich paths to explore. The DM might d escrib e the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they w ant their adventurers to do. W ill they w alk a cro ss the dangerously w eathered draw bridge? Tie them selves together with rope to m ini­ m ize the ch a n ce that som eon e w ill fall if the draw bridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm ? Then the DM determ ines the results o f the adventur­ ers’ actions and narrates what they e xperien ce. B ecau se the DM can im provise to react to anything the players attempt, D & D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected. The gam e has no real end; w hen on e story or quest w ra ps up, another one can begin, creating an on goin g story called a campaign. M any p eop le w h o play the gam e keep their cam p aign s going for m onths or years, m eetin g with their friends every w eek or s o to pick up the story w here they left off. T h e adventurers g row in m ight as the cam paign continues. Each m onster defeated, each adventure com pleted, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers n ew capabilities. T h is in crease in pow er is reflected by an adventurer’s level. T h ere’s no w inning and losing in the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e—at least, not the way those term s are usually understood. Together, the D M and the players create an exciting story o f bold adventurers w ho confront deadly perils. S om etim es an adventurer m ight c om e to a grisly end, torn apart by ferociou s m onsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for pow erful m agic to revive their fallen com rade, or the player might c h o o s e to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to com plete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a g ood time and created a m em orable story, they all win. W o r l d s o f A d v e n t u r e The m any w orld s o f the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e are places o f m agic and m onsters, o f brave w arriors and sp ectacu lar adventures. They begin with a foundation o f m edieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and m agic that m ake these w orld s unique. T h e w orld s o f the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e exist w ithin a vast c o s m o s called the multiverse, con n ected in strange and m ysterious w ays to on e another and to other planes o f existence, such as the Elem ental Plane o f Fire and the Infinite D epths o f the A byss. W ithin this m ultiverse are an en dless variety o f w orlds. M any o f them have been published as official settings for the D & D game. T h e legends o f the Forgotten R ealm s, Drag- on lan ce, Greyhawk, D ark Sun, Mystara, and E berron settings are w oven together in the fabric o f the multi- verse. A longside these w orld s are hundreds o f thousands m ore, created by generations o f D & D players for their ow n gam es. A nd am id all the rich n ess o f the multiverse, you m ight create a w orld o f your ow n. All th ese w orlds share characteristics, but each w orld is set apart by its ow n history and cultures, distinctive m on sters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun­ geons, and sch em in g villains. S o m e races have unusual traits in different w orlds. T h e halflings o f the Dark Sun setting, for exam ple, are ju n gle-d w ellin g cannibals, and the elves are desert n om ads. S om e w orld s feature races u nk n ow n in other settings, such as E b erron ’s w ar- forged, sold iers created and im bu ed with life to fight in the Last War. S o m e w orld s are dom inated by on e great story, like the W ar o f the L an ce that plays a central role in the D ragon lance setting. But they’re all D & D w orlds, and you can u se the rules in this b o o k to create a char­ acter and play in any one o f them. Your DM m ight set the cam paign on on e o f these w orld s or on on e that he or she created. B eca u se there is s o m uch diversity a m on g the w orlds o f D&D, you sh ou ld ch eck w ith your DM about any h ou se rules that w ill affect your play o f the gam e. Ultimately, the D un­ geon M aster is the authority on the cam paign and its setting, even if the setting is a published w orld. U s i n g T h i s B o o k T h e Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts. Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the rules and g u id an ce you n eed to m ake the character y ou ’ll play in the gam e. It includes inform ation on the various races, classes, backgrou n ds, equipm ent, and oth er custom ization options that you can c h o o s e from. M any o f the rules in part 1 rely on m aterial in parts 2 and 3. If you co m e a cro ss a gam e con cep t in part 1 that you d on ’t understand, consult the b o o k ’s index. Part 2 details the rules o f h ow to play the gam e, beyon d the b a sics d escrib ed in this introduction. That part covers the kinds o f die rolls you m ake to determ ine s u c ce s s or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and d escrib es the three broad categories o f activity in the gam e: exploration, interaction, and com bat. Part 3 is all about m agic. It covers the nature o f m agic in the w orld s o f D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety o f spells available to m agic-using ch a ra c­ ters (and m onsters) in the game. How t o P l a y T he play o f the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e unfolds a ccord in g to this basic pattern. 1. The DM describes the environment. T h e DM tells the players w here their adventurers are and w hat’s around them, presenting the basic s c o p e o f options that present th em selves (h ow m any d oors lead out o f a room , w hat’s on a table, w h o ’s in the tavern, and so on). 2. The players describe what they want to do. S o m e ­ tim es on e player sp eak s for the w h ole party, saying, “W e’ll take the east door,” for exam ple. Other tim es, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer m ight sea rch a treasure chest w hile a se c o n d exam in es an esoteric sym b ol engraved on a w all and a third keeps w atch for m onsters. T h e players d on ’t n eed to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and d ecides h ow to resolve th ose actions. S om etim es, resolvin g a task is easy. If an adventurer w ants to w alk a cross a room and op en a door, the DM might just say that the d oor op en s and d escrib e w hat lies beyond. But the d oor might b e lock ed, the floor m ight hide a deadly trap, or som e other circu m stan ce m ight m ake it challen ging for an adventurer to com plete a task. In th ose cases, the DM d ecid es w hat happens, often relying on the roll o f a die to determ ine the results o f an action. 3. The DM narrates the results o f the adventurers’ actions. D escribin g the results often leads to another d ecision point, w hich brin gs the flow o f the gam e right ba ck to step 1. T h is pattern holds w hether the adventurers are cau ­ tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a deviou s prince, or lock ed in m ortal com bat against a m ighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly com bat, the action is m ore structured and the players (and D M ) d o take turns ch oosin g and resolvin g actions. But m ost o f the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circu m stan ces o f the adventure. Often the action o f an adventure takes place in the im agination o f the players and DM, relying on the D M ’s verbal descriptions to set the scen e. S o m e D M s like to use m usic, art, or r ecord ed sou n d effects to help set the m ood , and m any players and D M s alike adopt different v oices for the various adventurers, m onsters, and other characters they play in the gam e. S om etim es, a DM m ight lay out a m ap and u se tokens or m iniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scen e to help the players k eep track o f w here everyone is. G a m e D i c e T h e gam e u ses polyhedral dice w ith different num bers o f sides. You can find d ice like th ese in gam e stores and in m any book stores. In these rules, the different d ice are referred to by the letter d follow ed by the num ber o f sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, d 12, and d20. F or instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cu b e that m any g am es use). P ercen tile dice, or d 100, w ork a little differently. You generate a num ber b etw een 1 and 100 by rolling tw o different ten-sided d ice n um bered from 0 to 9. O ne die (designated b efore you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the on es digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for exam ple, the num ber rolled is 71. Tw o Os represent 100. S o m e ten-sided dice are num bered in tens (00, 10, 20, and s o on), m akin g it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the o n es digit. In this case, a roll o f 70 and 1 is 71, and 0 0 and 0 is 100. W h en you n eed to roll dice, the rules tell you h ow m any d ice to roll o f a certain type, as w ell as w hat m o d ­ ifiers to add. For exam ple, “ 3d8 + 5 ” m eans you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total. The sa m e d notation appears in the ex p ression s “ 1d 3 ” and “ 1d2.” To sim ulate the roll o f 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up). To sim ulate the roll o f 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depen din g on w hether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively, if the num ber rolled is m ore than h alf the num ber o f sides on the die, it’s a 2.) T h e D 2 0 D o e s an adventurer’s sw ord sw in g hurt a dragon or just b ou n ce off its iron-hard sca les? W ill the ogre believe an ou trageous bluff? Can a character sw im a cross a raging river? Can a character avoid the m ain blast o f a fireball, or d o e s he or she take full dam age from the blaze? In ca se s w h ere the ou tcom e o f an action is uncertain, the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e relies on rolls o f a 20 -sid ed die, a d20, to determ ine s u c ce s s or failure. Every character and m onster in the gam e has capa­ bilities defined by six ability scores. T h e abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom , and Charism a, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for m ost adventurers. (M onsters m ight have s co re s as low as 1 or as high as 30.) T h ese ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them , are the basis for alm ost every d2 0 roll that a player m a k es on a ch arac­ ter’s or m on ster’s behalf. Ability ch eck s, attack rolls, and saving throw s are the three m ain kinds o f d2 0 rolls, form in g the core o f the rules o f the gam e. All three follow th ese sim ple steps. 1. Roll the die and add a modifier. R oll a d2 0 and add the relevant modifier. T h is is typically the m od ­ ifier derived from on e o f the six ability s cores, and it som etim es includes a proficiency bon u s to reflect a char­ acter’s particular skill. (S e e chapter 1 for details on each ability and h ow to determ ine an ability’s modifier.) 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A cla ss feature, a spell, a particular circu m stan ce, or som e other effect m ight give a b on u s or penalty to the check. 3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or e x ceed s the target num ber, the ability check, attack roll, or saving th row is a su ccess. O therw ise, it’s a failure. T h e D M is usually the on e w h o determ ines target num bers and tells players w hether their ability ch ecks, attack rolls, and saving th row s su cce e d or fail. Th e target num ber for an ability ch eck o r a saving th row is called a Difficulty Class (D C). T h e target num ber for an attack roll is called an Arm or Class (AC). T h is sim ple rule governs the resolution o f m ost tasks in D & D play. Chapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules for usin g the d 2 0 in the game. A d v a n t a g e a n d D i s a d v a n t a g e S om etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is m od ified by sp ecia l situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circu m ­ stan ces su rrou nding a d2 0 roll, w hile disadvantage reflects the opposite. W h en you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a se co n d d2 0 w h en you m ake the roll. U se the higher o f the tw o rolls if you have advan­ tage, and u se the low er roll if you have disadvantage. F or exam ple, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll th ose num bers, you use the 17. M ore detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7. S p e c i f i c B e a t s G e n e r a l T h is b o o k contain s rules, esp ecia lly in parts 2 and 3, that govern h ow the gam e plays. That said, m any racial traits, class features, spells, m agic item s, m on ster abili­ ties, and other gam e elem ents break the general rules in som e way, creating an exception to h ow the rest o f the gam e w orks. R em em ber this: If a sp ecific rule contra­ dicts a general rule, the sp ecific rule w ins. E xception s to the rules are often m inor. For instance, m any adventurers d on ’t have proficiency with lon gbow s, but every w o o d elf d oes b e ca u se o f a racial trait. That trait creates a m in or exception in the gam e. Other exam ples o f rule-breaking are m ore con sp icu ou s. For instance, an adventurer ca n ’t n orm ally p ass through w alls, but som e sp ells m ake that possible. M agic accou n ts for m ost o f the m ajor exception s to the rules. R o u n d D o w n T h ere’s on e m ore general rule you n eed to k n ow at the outset. W h enever you divide a num ber in the gam e, round dow n if you end up w ith a fraction, even if the fraction is on e-half or greater. A d v e n t u r e s T h e D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e con sists o f a group o f characters em barking on an adventure that the D un ­ geon M aster presen ts to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form o f ability sc o r e s and skills, class features, racial traits, equipm ent, and m agic item s. Every character is dif­ ferent, w ith various strengths and w ea k n esses, s o the best party o f adventurers is on e in w h ich the characters com plem ent each other and cover the w ea k n esses o f their com pa n ion s. The adventurers must coop era te to su ccessfu lly com plete the adventure. T h e adventure is the heart o f the gam e, a story with a beginning, a m iddle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the D u n geon M aster or p u rch ased off the shelf, tw eaked and m odified to suit the D M ’s n eeds and desires. In either ca se, an adventure features a fantastic setting, w hether it’s an u nderground dungeon, a cru m ­ bling castle, a stretch o f w ildern ess, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast o f characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as w ell as nonplayer characters (N PC s). T h ose char­ acters m ight b e patrons, allies, enem ies, hirelings, or just backgrou n d extras in an adventure. Often, on e o f the N P C s is a villain w h ose agenda drives m uch o f an adventure’s action. Over the cou rse o f their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety o f creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal w ith in som e way. S o m e ­ tim es the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in com bat. At other tim es, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a m agical object) w ith a goal in mind. A nd often, the adventurers spend tim e trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find som eth in g hidden, or unravel the cu r­ rent situation. M eanw hile, the adventurers explore the w orld, m akin g decision s about w hich w ay to travel and w hat they’ll try to do next. A dventures vary in length and com plexity. A short adventure m ight present only a few challen ges, and it m ight take no m ore than a single gam e session to com plete. A long adventure can involve hundreds o f com bats, interactions, and other challen ges, and take d ozen s o f session s to play through, stretching over w eek s or m onths o f real tim e. Usually, the end o f an adventure is m arked by the adventurers h eading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the sp oils o f their labors. But that’s not the end o f the story. You can think o f an adventure as a single ep isod e o f a T V series, m ade up o f multiple exciting scen es. A cam paign is the w hole s eries—a string o f adventures jo in e d together, with a consistent group o f adventurers follow in g the narrative from start to finish. T h e T h r e e P i l l a r s o f A d v e n t u r e A dventurers ca n try to do anything their players can im agine, but it can b e helpful to talk about their activ­ ities in three broad categories: exploration, socia l interaction, and com bat. Exploration includes both the adventurers’ m ovem ent through the w orld and their interaction with ob jects and situations that require their attention. E xploration is the give-and-take o f the players describin g what they want their characters to do, and the D u n geon M aster telling the players w hat h appen s as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spen din g a day c r o s s ­ ing a rolling plain or an hour m aking their w ay through caverns underground. On the sm allest scale, it could m ean on e character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see w hat happens. Social interaction features the adventurers talking to som eon e (or som eth in g) else. It might m ean dem anding that a captured scou t reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting inform ation from a rescu ed prisoner, pleading for m ercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative m agic m irror to sh ow a distant location to the adventurers. The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and socia l interaction, as do m any cla ss features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4. Combat, the focu s o f chapter 9, involves characters and other creatu res sw in ging w eapon s, casting spells, m aneuvering for position, and s o o n —all in an effort to defeat their oppon en ts, w hether that m eans killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcin g a rout. Com bat is the m ost structured elem ent o f a D & D session , with creatu res taking turns to m ake sure that everyone gets a ch a n ce to act. Even in the context o f a pitched battle, there’s still plenty o f opportunity for adventurers to attempt w acky stunts like surfing dow n a flight o f stairs on a shield, to exam ine the environm ent (perhaps by pulling a m ysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, en em ies, and neutral parties. T h e W o n d e r s o f M a g i c Few D & D adventures end w ithout som eth in g m agical happening. W h eth er helpful or harm ful, m agic appears frequently in the life o f an adventurer, and it is the focu s o f chapters 10 and 11. In the w orld s o f D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s , practitioners o f m agic are rare, set apart from the m a sses o f people by their extraordinary talent. C om m on folk might see eviden ce o f m agic on a regular basis, but it’s usually m in or—a fantastic m onster, a visibly an sw ered prayer, a w izard w alking through the streets w ith an anim ated shield guardian as a bodyguard. For adventurers, though, m agic is key to their sur­ vival. W ithout the healing m agic o f clerics and paladins, adventurers w ou ld quickly su ccu m b to their w oun ds. W ithout the uplifting m agical su pport o f bards and clerics, w arriors m ight be overw helm ed by p ow erfu l foes. W ithout the sh eer m agical p ow er and versatility o f w izards and druids, every threat w ou ld be m ag­ nified tenfold. M agic is also a favored tool o f villains. M any adven­ tures are driven by the m achinations o f spellcasters w h o are hellbent on using m agic for som e ill end. A cult leader seek s to aw aken a god w h o slum bers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to m agically drain them o f their vigor, a m ad w izard labors to invest an arm y o f autom atons with a facsim ile o f life, a dragon begin s a m ystical ritual to rise up as a god o f destruction —these are just a few o f the m agical threats that adventurers m ight face. W ith m agic o f their ow n, in the form o f sp ells and m agic items, the adventurers m ight prevail! C h a p t e r 1: St e p - b y - S t e p C h a r a c t e r s OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e is to im agine and create a character o f your ow n. Your character is a com bination o f gam e statistics, roleplaying h ook s, and your im agination. You c h o o s e a race (such as hum an or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or w izard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory o f your character. O n ce com pleted, your character serves as your representative in the gam e, your avatar in the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s w orld. B efore you dive into step 1 below , think about the kind o f adventurer you w ant to play. You m ight be a cou ra g eou s fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flam boyant w izard. Or you m ight be m ore interested in an u nconventional character, such as a braw ny rogue w h o likes hand-to-hand com bat, or a sh arpsh ooter w ho picks o ff en em ies from afar. D o you like fantasy fiction featuring dw arves or elves? Try building a character o f on e o f th ose races. D o you w ant your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? C on sider a class like barbarian or paladin. If y ou d on ’t k n ow w here else to begin, take a lo o k at the illustrations in this b o o k to see w hat catch es y ou r interest. O nce you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, m akin g decision s that reflect the character you want. Your con cep tion o f your character m ight evolve with each c h o ice you m ake. W h a t’s im portant is that you co m e to the table w ith a character you ’re excited to play. T h rou gh ou t this chapter, w e u se the term character sheet to m ean w hatever you u se to track your character, w hether it’s a form al character sheet (like the on e at the end o f this book ), so m e form o f digital record, or a piece o f n oteb ook paper. A n official D & D character sheet is a fine place to start until you k n ow w hat inform ation you need and h ow you u se it during the gam e. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r E ach step o f character creation includes an exam ple o f that step, w ith a player nam ed B ob building his dw arf character, Bruenor. 1. C h o o s e a R a c e Every character b elon g s to a race, on e o f the m any intelligent h um anoid sp e cie s in the D & D w orld. The m ost co m m o n player character races are dw arves, elves, halflings, and hum ans. S o m e races also have subraces, such as m ountain dw arf or w o o d elf. Chapter 2 provides m ore inform ation about th ese races, as w ell as the less w idesp rea d races o f dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. The race you c h o o s e contributes to your character’s identity in an im portant way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as sp ecial sen ses, proficiency with certain w eapon s or tools, proficiency in on e or m ore skills, or the ability to use m inor spells. T h ese traits som etim es dovetail with the capabilities o f certain cla sses (see step 2). For exam ple, the racial traits o f lightfoot halflings m ake them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be pow erfu l w izards. S om etim es playing against type can b e fun, too. H alf-orc paladins and m ountain dw arf w izards, for exam ple, can b e unusual but m em orable characters. Your race also in creases on e or m ore o f your ability scores, w hich you determ ine in step 3. N ote these in creases and rem em ber to apply them later. R e co rd the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. B e sure to note your starting languages and your ba se sp eed as w ell. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , S t e p 1 B ob is sitting dow n to create his character. H e d ecides that a gru ff m ountain dw arf fits the character he w ants to play. He notes all the racial traits o f dw arves on his character sheet, including his sp eed o f 25 feet and the languages he kn ow s: C om m on and D w arvish. 2. C h o o s e a C l a s s Every adventurer is a m em ber o f a class. C lass broadly d escrib es a character’s vocation, w hat sp ecia l talents he or sh e p o s se ss e s, and the tactics he or she is m ost likely to em ploy w hen exploring a dungeon, fighting m onsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. T h e character cla sses are d escrib ed in chapter 3. Your character receives a num ber o f benefits from your ch oice o f class. M any o f th ese benefits are class features—capabilities (including spellcastin g) that set your character apart from m em bers o f other classes. You also gain a num ber o f proficiencies: armor, w eapon s, skills, saving throw s, and som etim es tools. Your p roficien cies define m any o f the things your character can do particularly w ell, from u sing certain w ea p on s to telling a convin cin g lie. On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level. L e v e l Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (X P). A 1st-level character is in exp erien ced in the adventuring w orld, although he or she m ight have been a soldier or a pirate and don e dangerou s things before. Starting off at 1st level m arks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you ’re already fam iliar w ith the gam e, or if you are join in g an existing D & D cam paign, your DM might d ecide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assum ption that your character has already survived a few harrow in g adventures. Q u i c k B u i l d Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character o f that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells. PART 1 S T E P -B Y -S T E P C H A R A C T E R S R e co rd your level on your character sheet. If you ’re starting at a h igher level, record the additional elem ents your class gives you for your levels past 1st. A lso record your exp erien ce points. A 1st-level character has 0 X P A higher-level character typically beg in s w ith the m inim um am ount o f X P required to reach that level (see “B eyond 1st L evel” later in this chapter). H i t P o i n t s a n d H i t D i c e Y our character’s hit points define h ow tough your character is in com bat and other dangerou s situations. Your hit points are determ ined by your Hit D ice (short for Hit Point Dice). A b i l i t y S c o r e S u m m a r y Strength M easures: Natural athleticism, bodily power Im p ortan t for: Barbarian, fighter, paladin R acial Increases: Mountain dwarf (+2) Half-orc (+2) Dragonborn (+2) Human (+1) Dexterity M easures: Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise Im p ortan t for: Monk, ranger, rogue R acial Increases: Elf (+2) Forest gnome (+1) Halfling (+2) Human (+1) Constitution M easures: Health, stamina, vital force Im p ortan t for: Everyone R acial Increases: Dwarf (+2) Half-orc (+1) Stout halfling (+1) Human (+1) Rock gnome (+1) Intelligence M easures: Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill Im p ortan t for: Wizard Racial Increases: High elf (+1) Tiefling (+1) Gnome (+2) Human (+1) W isdom M easures: A w a re n e ss, intuition, insight Im p ortan t for: Cleric, druid R acial Increases: Hill dwarf (+1) Human (+1) Wood elf (+1) Charisma M easures: Confidence, eloquence, leadership Im p ortan t for: Bard, sorcerer, warlock R acial Increases: Half-elf (+2) Dragonborn (+1) Drow (+1) Human (+1) Lightfoot halfling (+1) Tiefling (+2) At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit D ie, and the die type is determ ined by your class. You start w ith hit points equal to the h ighest roll o f that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, w h ich you ’ll determ ine in step 3.) T h is is also your hit point maxim um . R e c o rd y ou r character’s hit points on your character sheet. A lso record the type o f Hit D ie your character u ses and the num ber o f Hit D ice you have. A fter you rest, you can sp end Hit D ice to regain hit points (see “R estin g ” in chapter 8). P r o f i c i e n c y B o n u s Th e table that appears in your class description sh ow s your proficiency bonus, w h ich is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your p roficiency bon u s applies to m any o f the num bers y ou ’ll be record in g on your character sheet: • A ttack rolls using w ea p on s y ou ’re proficient with • A ttack rolls w ith spells you cast • Ability ch eck s using skills y ou ’re proficient in • Ability ch eck s using tools y ou ’re proficient with • Saving th row s y ou ’re proficient in • Saving th row D C s for spells you cast (explained in each sp ellcastin g class) Y our class determ ines your w ea p on proficiencies, your saving th row p roficiencies, and som e o f your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are d escrib ed in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Y our backgrou n d gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and so m e races give you m ore proficiencies. B e sure to note all o f these proficiencies, as w ell as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet. Your proficiency bon u s can ’t be added to a single die roll or other n um ber m ore than on ce. O ccasionally, your proficiency bon u s m ight be m od ified (doubled or halved, for exam ple) before you apply it. If a circu m stan ce su ggests that your p roficiency b on u s applies m ore than on ce to the sa m e roll or that it sh ou ld be m ultiplied m ore than on ce, you n evertheless add it only on ce, multiply it only on ce, and halve it only on ce. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , S t e p 2 B ob im agines B ruenor chargin g into battle w ith an axe, on e horn on his helm et broken off. H e m akes B ru enor a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficien cies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet. A s a 1st-level fighter, B ru enor has 1 Hit D ie—a d 10— and starts with hit poin ts equal to 10 + his Constitution m odifier. B ob notes this, and w ill record the final num ber after he determ ines B ru en or’s Constitution sc o r e (see step 3). B ob a lso notes the proficiency bon u s for a 1st-level character, w hich is +2. 3 . D e t e r m i n e A b i l i t y S c o r e s M uch o f w hat your character d o e s in the gam e depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma. Each ability has a score, w h ich is a num ber you record on your character sheet. T h e six abilities and their u se in the gam e are describ ed in chapter 7. T h e Ability S c o r e S u m m ary table provides a quick referen ce for w hat qualities are m easu red by each ability, w hat races in creases w hich abilities, and what cla sses con sid er each ability particularly im portant. You generate your character's six ability scores randomly. R oll fou r 6-sided dice and record the total o f the highest three dice on a p iece o f scratch paper. D o this five m ore tim es, s o that you have six num bers. If you w ant to save tim e or d on ’t like the idea o f random ly determ ining ability scores, you can u se the follow in g s c o r e s instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. N ow take your six n um bers and w rite each num ber b eside on e o f your character’s six abilities to assign sco re s to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom , and Charism a. A fterw ard, m ake any changes to your ability s c o r e s as a result o f your race choice. After assign in g your ability s cores, determ ine your ability modifiers using the Ability S c o r e s and M odifiers table. To determ ine an ability m odifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). W rite the m odifier next to each o f your scores. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , S t e p 3 B ob d ecid es to u se the standard set o f s c o r e s (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for B ru enor’s abilities. S in ce h e’s a fighter, he puts his h ighest score, 15, in Strength. H is next- highest, 14, g oes in Constitution. B ruenor m ight be a brash fighter, but B ob d ecid es he w ants the dw arf to be older, w iser, and a g o o d leader, so he puts decent sc o r e s in W isd om and Charism a. After applying his racial benefits (in creasin g B ru en or’s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), B ru en or’s ability s c o r e s and m odifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), W isd om 13 (+1), C harism a 12 (+1). B ob fills in B ru enor's final hit points: 10 + his Constitution m odifier o f +3, for a total o f 13 hit points. V a r i a n t : C u s t o m i z i n g A b i l i t y S c o r e s At your D u n geon M aster’s option, you can use this variant for determ ining your ability scores. The m ethod describ ed here allow s you to build a character w ith a set o f ability s c o r e s you c h o o s e individually. You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. T h e co st o f each sc o r e is sh ow n on the Ability S c o r e Point C ost table. F or exam ple, a sc o r e o f 14 costs 7 points. U sing this m ethod, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, b efore applying racial in creases. Y ou ca n ’t have a sc o r e low er than 8. T h is m ethod o f determ ining ability s c o r e s enables you to create a set o f three high num bers and three low on es (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set o f num bers that are above A b i l i t y S c o r e P o i n t C o s t A b i l i t y S c o r e s a n d M o d i f i e r s Score Modifier Score Modifier 1 -5 16-17 +3 2-3 -4 18-19 +4 4 -5 -3 20-21 +5 6-7 -2 22-23 +6 8-9 -1 24-25 +7 10-11 +0 26-27 +8 12-13 +1 28-29 +9 14-15 +2 30 +10 average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set o f num bers betw een th ose extrem es. 4 .

U sing the inform ation in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearan ce and personality traits. C h oose your character’s alignment (the m oral c om p a ss that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds m ost dear, called bonds, and the flaws that cou ld one day u nderm ine him or her. Your character’s background d escrib es w here he or she ca m e from , his or her original occu pation , and the character’s place in the D & D w orld. Your DM might offer additional ba ckgrou n ds beyon d the on es included Score Cost Score Cost 8 0 12 4 9 1 13 5 10 2 14 7 11 3 15 9 in chapter 4, and m ight b e w illing to w ork w ith you to craft a b a ckgrou n d that’s a m ore p recise fit for your character concept. A b ackgrou n d gives your character a backgrou n d feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in tw o skills, and it m ight also give you additional languages or proficiency w ith certain kinds o f tools. R e c o rd this inform ation, along w ith the person ality inform ation you develop, on your character sheet. Y o u r C h a r a c t e r ’ s A b i l i t i e s Take your character’s ability s c o r e s and race into accou n t as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very stron g character w ith low Intelligence m ight think and behave very differently from a very sm art character w ith low Strength. For exam ple, high Strength usually c o rresp on d s w ith a burly or athletic body, w hile a character with low Strength m ight be scraw ny or plump. A character w ith high D exterity is probably lithe and slim , w hile a character w ith low D exterity m ight be either gangly and aw kw ard or heavy and thick-fingered. A character w ith high Constitution usually look s healthy, w ith bright eyes and abundant energy. A character w ith low Constitution m ight b e sickly or frail. A character with high Intelligence m ight be highly inquisitive and studious, w hile a character w ith low Intelligence might sp eak sim ply or easily forget details. A character w ith high W isd om has g ood judgm ent, empathy, and a general aw aren ess o f w hat’s going on. A character w ith low W isd om m ight be absent-m inded, foolhardy, or oblivious. A character with high C harism a exudes confidence, w h ich is usually m ixed w ith a graceful or intim idating presen ce. A character w ith a low C harism a m ight co m e a cross as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , S t e p 4 B o b fills in so m e o f B ru enor’s ba sic details: his nam e, his sex (male), his height and w eight, and his alignm ent (law ful good). H is high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence su ggests a degree o f forgetfulness. B ob d ecid es that B ru enor c o m e s from a n oble line, but his clan w as expelled from its hom eland w hen B ru enor w as very young. He g rew up w ork in g as a sm ith in the rem ote villages o f Icew ind Dale. But B ruenor has a h eroic destiny—to reclaim his h om eland—so B ob c h o o s e s the folk h ero back grou n d for his dwarf. H e notes the proficiencies and sp ecia l feature this ba ck grou n d gives him. B ob has a pretty clear picture o f B ru en or’s personality in mind, so he skips the person ality traits su ggested in the folk h ero backgrou n d, noting instead that B ru enor is a caring, sensitive d w arf w h o genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling dem eanor. H e c h o o s e s the ideal o f fairn ess from the list in his backgrou n d, noting that Bruenor believes that n o on e is above the law. G iven his history, B ru en or’s bon d is obvious: he aspires to som eday reclaim M ithral Hall, his hom eland, from the sh ad ow dragon that drove the dw arves out. H is flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and w ayw ard souls, leading him to sh ow m ercy even w hen it m ight not b e w arranted. 5 . C h o o s e E q u i p m e n t Your class and backgrou n d determ ine your character's starting equipment, including w eapon s, armor, and other adventuring gear. R e c o rd this equipm ent on your character sheet. All such item s are detailed in chapter 5. Instead o f taking the gear given to you by your class and backgrou n d, you ca n p u rch ase your starting equipm ent. You have a num ber o f gold pieces (gp) to spend ba sed on your class, as sh ow n in chapter 5. Extensive lists o f equipm ent, w ith prices, a lso appear in that chapter. If you w ish, you can also have on e trinket at n o cost (see the trinket table at the end o f chapter 5). Your Strength sc o r e lim its the am ount o f gear you can carry. Try not to pu rch ase equipm ent w ith a total w eight (in pounds) ex ceed in g your Strength sco re tim es 15. Chapter 7 has m ore inform ation on carrying capacity. A r m o r C l a s s Your A rm or Class (AC) represents h ow w ell your character avoids being w ou n d ed in battle. T h in gs that contribute to your AC include the arm or you w ear, the shield you carry, and your D exterity m odifier. Not all characters w ea r arm or or carry shields, however. W ithout arm or or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity m odifier. If your character w ea rs arm or, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 5. R e co rd your AC on your character sheet. Your character n eeds to be proficient w ith arm or and shields to w ea r and u se them effectively, and your arm or and shield proficien cies are determ ined by your class. T h ere are draw backs to w earin g arm or or carryin g a shield if you lack the requ ired proficiency, as explained in chapter 5. S o m e spells and class features give you a different w ay to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different w ays to calculate you r AC, you c h o o s e w hich one to use. W e a p o n s For each w eap on your character w ields, calculate the m odifier you u se w h en you attack w ith the w ea p on and the dam age you deal w hen you hit. W h en you m ake an attack w ith a w eapon , you roll a d2 0 and add your proficiency bon u s (but only if you are proficient w ith the w eapon ) and the appropriate ability modifier. • F or attacks w ith m elee weapons, use your Strength m odifier for attack and dam age rolls. A w eap on that has the fin esse property, such as a rapier, ca n u se your D exterity m odifier instead. • F or attacks w ith ranged weapons, u se your D exterity m odifier for attack and dam age rolls. A w ea p on that has the throw n property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength m odifier instead. B u i l d i n g B r u e n o r , S t e p 5 B ob w rites dow n the starting equipm ent from the fighter cla ss and the folk h ero background.

B e y o n d 1s t L e v e l A s your character g o e s on adventures and ov ercom es challen ges, he or she gains experience, represented by experien ce points. A character w h o reach es a sp ecified experien ce point total advances in capability. This advancem ent is called gaining a level. W h en your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. S o m e o f these features allow you to in crease your ability scores, either increasin g tw o s c o r e s by 1 each or in creasin g on e sco re by 2. You c a n ’t in crease an ability s c o r e above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bon u s in creases at certain levels. Each tim e you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. R oll that Hit Die, add your Constitution m odifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point m axim um . Alternatively, you can use the fixed value sh ow n in your class entry, w hich is the average result o f the die roll (rounded up). W h en your Constitution m odifier in creases by 1, your hit point m axim u m in creases by 1 for each level you have attained. F or exam ple, w hen B ruenor reaches 8th level as a fighter, he in creases his Constitution sco re from 17 to 18, thus increasin g his Constitution m odifier from +3 to +4.

T i e r s o f P l a y The shading in the Character Advancement table show s the four tiers o f play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description o f how the play experience changes as characters gain levels. In the first tier (levels 1 -4 ), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. Th ey are learn in g the features that define them as m em bers o f particular classes, including the m ajor ch o ice s that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a w iza rd ’s A rcane Tradition or a fighter’s M artial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually p o sin g a danger to local farm steads or villages. In the secon d tier (levels 5 -1 0 ), characters c om e into their ow n. M any spellcasters gain a c c e s s to 3rd-level spells at the start o f this tier, crossin g a new threshold o f m agical p ow er with spells such as fireball and lightning bolt. At this tier, m any w eapon -usin g cla sses gain the ability to m ake multiple attacks in on e round. T h ese characters have b e c o m e im portant, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdom s. In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have reached a level o f p ow er that sets them high above the ordinary pop u la ce and m akes them sp ecia l even am ong adventurers. At 11th level, m any spellcasters gain a c c e s s to 6th-level spells, so m e o f w h ich create effects previously im possible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to m ake m ore attacks or do m ore im pressive things with th ose attacks. T h ese m ighty adventurers often confront threats to w h ole region s and continents. At the fourth tier (levels 17 -20 ), characters achieve the pinnacle o f their cla ss features, b ecom in g h eroic (or villainous) archetypes in their ow n right. The fate o f the w orld or even the fundam ental order o f the m ultiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.

Scattered a m on g the m em bers o f these m ore com m on races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his w ay through the crow d, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the sh ad ow s w ith m isch ief in her eyes. A group o f g n om es laughs as on e o f them activates a clever w o o d e n toy that m oves o f its ow n accord. H alf- elves and h alf-orcs live and w ork alongside hum ans, w ithout fully belon gin g to the races o f either o f their parents. A n d there, w ell out o f the sunlight, is a lone d row —a fugitive from the subterranean expan se o f the Underdark, trying to m ake his w ay in a w orld that fears his kind. C h o o s i n g a R a c e H um ans are the m ost com m on p eople in the w orld s o f D&D, but they live and w ork alongside dw arves, elves, halflings, and cou n tless other fantastic sp ecies. Your character belon g s to on e o f th ese p eoples. Not every intelligent race o f the m ultiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. D w arves, elves, halflings, and hum ans are the m ost com m on races to p rod u ce the sort o f adventurers w h o m ake up typical parties. D ragonborn, g n om es, half-elves, half- orcs, and tieflings are less com m on as adventurers. D row , a su brace o f elves, are also u ncom m on. Your ch oice o f race affects m any different aspects o f your character. It establishes fundam ental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. W h en m akin g this decision, keep in m ind the kind o f character you w ant to play. F or exam ple, a halfling could be a g o o d ch oice for a sneaky rogue, a dw arf m akes a tough warrior, and an elf can b e a master o f arcane m agic. Y our character race not only affects your ability s c o r e s and traits but also provides the cu e s for building your character’s story. E ach race’s description in this chapter includes inform ation to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features o f society, and racial alignm ent tendencies. T h ese details are su ggestion s to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate w idely from the n orm for their race. It’s w orthw h ile to con sid er w hy your character is different, as a helpful w ay to think about y ou r character’s backgrou n d and personality. R a c i a l T r a i t s The description o f each race in cludes racial traits that are com m on to m em bers o f that race. T h e follow in g entries appear am ong the traits o f m ost races.

A g e T h e age entry notes the age w hen a m em ber o f the race is con sid ered an adult, as w ell as the race’s expected lifespan. T h is inform ation can help you d ecide h ow old your character is at the start o f the gam e. You can c h o o s e any age for your character, w h ich cou ld provide an explanation for so m e o f your ability scores. For exam ple, if you play a youn g or very old character, your age cou ld explain a particularly low S trength or Constitution score, w hile advanced age cou ld accoun t for a high Intelligence or W isdom . A l i g n m e n t M ost races have tendencies tow ard certain alignm ents, d escribed in this entry. T h ese are not binding for player characters, but con siderin g w hy your d w arf is chaotic, for exam ple, in defiance o f lawful dw arf society can help you better define your character. S i z e Characters o f m ost races are M edium , a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. M em bers o f a few races are Sm all (betw een 2 and 4 feet tall), w hich m eans that certain rules o f the gam e affect them differently. T h e m ost im portant o f th ese rules is that S m all characters have trouble w ieldin g heavy w eapon s, as explained in chapter 6. S p e e d Your sp eed determ ines h ow far you can m ove w hen traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9). L a n g u a g e s By virtue o f your race, your character can speak, read, and w rite certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the m ost co m m o n languages o f the D & D multiverse. S u b r a c e s S o m e ra ces have subraces. M em bers o f a subrace have the traits o f the parent race in addition to the traits sp ecified for their subrace. R elationships am ong su braces vary significantly from race to race and w orld to w orld. In the D ragon lance cam p aign setting, for exam ple, m ountain dw arves and hill dw arves live together as different clans o f the sam e people, but in the Forgotten R ealm s, they live far apart in separate kin gdom s and call th em selves shield dw arves and gold dw arves, respectively. S h o r t a n d S t o u t B old and hardy, dw arves are kn ow n as skilled w arriors, m iners, and w orkers o f stone and metal. T h ough they stand w ell under 5 feet tall, dw arves are so broad and com pact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly tw o feet taller. Th eir cou rag e and endurance are also easily a match for any o f the larger folk. D w arven skin ranges from deep brow n to a paler hue tinged with red, but the m ost com m on sh ades are light brow n or deep tan, like certain ton es o f earth. Th eir hair, w orn long but in sim ple styles, is usually black, gray, or brow n, though paler dw arves often have red hair. M ale dw arves value their beard s highly and g room them carefully. L o n g M e m o r y , L o n g G r u d g e s D w arves can live to be m ore than 4 0 0 years old, so the oldest living dw arves often rem em ber a very different w orld. F or exam ple, som e o f the oldest dw arves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the w orld o f the Forgotten R ealm s) can recall the day, m ore than three centuries ago, w hen or c s con q u ered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 2 5 0 years. T h is longevity grants them a perspective on the w orld that shorter-lived races such as hum ans and halflings lack. D w arves are solid and enduring like the m ountains they love, w eathering the pa ssa ge o f centuries with stoic endurance and little change. Th ey resp ect the traditions o f their clans, tracing their an cestry ba ck to the fou nding o f their m ost ancient stron gholds in the youth o f the w orld, and don't abandon th ose traditions lightly. Part o f th ose traditions is devotion to the g od s o f the dw arves, w h o uphold the dw arven ideals o f industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge. Individual dw arves are determ ined and loyal, true to their w ord and decisive in action, som etim es to the point o f stu bborn n ess. M any dw arves have a strong sen se K in gdom s rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots o f m ountains, the ech oin g o f picks and h am m ers in deep m ines and blazing forges, a com m itm en t to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred o f goblins and orc s —th ese co m m o n threads unite all dw arves. “Y e r l a t e , e l f !” c a m e t h e r o u g h e d g e o f a f a m i l i a r voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray- streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find y e in trouble if I came out an' looked for ye!" —R. A . S a lvatore, The Crystal Shard D w a r f o f ju stice, and they are slow to forget w ron g s they have suffered. A w ron g don e to one dw arf is a w ron g done to the d w a rf’s entire clan, so w hat begin s as on e dw arf’s hunt for ven gean ce can b e c o m e a full-blow n clan feud. C l a n s a n d K i n g d o m s D w arven kin gdom s stretch deep beneath the m ountains w here the dw arves m ine gem s and preciou s m etals and forge item s o f w onder. They love the beauty and artistry o f preciou s m etals and fine jew elry, and in som e dw arves this love festers into avarice. W hatever w ealth they ca n ’t find in their m ountains, they gain through trade. Th ey dislike boats, so enterprising hum ans and halflings frequently handle trade in dw arven g ood s along w ater routes. Trustw orthy m em bers o f other races are w elcom e in dw arf settlem ents, though so m e areas are off lim its even to them. T h e ch ief unit o f dw arven society is the clan, and dw arves highly value so cia l standing. Even dw arves w h o live far from their ow n k in gdom s cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recog n ize related dw arves, and invoke their an cestors’ n am es in oaths and curses. To be clan less is the w orst fate that can befall a dwarf. D w arves in other lands are typically artisans, esp ecia lly w eapon sm ith s, arm orers, and jew elers. S om e b e c o m e m ercen a ries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their cou rag e and loyalty. G o d s , G o l d , a n d C l a n D w a rves w h o take up the adventuring life m ight be m otivated by a desire for treasure—for its ow n sake, for a sp ecific p u rpose, or even out o f an altruistic desire to help others. Other dw arves are driven by the com m a n d or inspiration o f a deity, a direct calling or sim ply a desire to brin g glory to on e o f the dw arf gods. Clan and an cestry are also im portant m otivators. A d w a rf might seek to restore a clan ’s lost honor, avenge an ancient w ron g the clan suffered, or earn a new p lace w ithin the clan after having been exiled. Or a dw arf m ight search for the axe w ielded by a m ighty ancestor, lost on the field o f battle centuries ago. S l o w t o T r u s t Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member o f a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust. Elves. “ It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out o f the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.” Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?” Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin— a daughter or granddaughter, maybe— who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind o f dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.” D w a r f N a m e s A d w a rf’s nam e is granted by a clan elder, in a ccord a n ce with tradition. Every p roper dw arven nam e has been u sed and reu sed dow n through the generations. A d w a rf’s n am e b elon g s to the clan, not to the individual. A dw arf w h o m isu ses or brings sham e to a clan nam e is stripped o f the nam e and forbidden by law to use any dw arven nam e in its place.

They have innate magical abilities to become invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size. E lf “ I HAVE N EVER IM A G IN E D SU C H B E A U T Y E X ISTE D ,” Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost. Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glisten- ing spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. —M a rg a ret W eis & T ra cy H ick m a n , Dragons of Autumn Twilight Elves are a m agical p eop le o f otherw orldly grace, living in the w orld but not entirely part o f it. They live in p la ces o f ethereal beauty, in the m idst o f ancient forests or in silvery sp ires glittering w ith faerie light, w here soft m usic drifts through the air and gentle fragrances w aft on the breeze. Elves love nature and m agic, art and artistry, m usic and poetry, and the g o o d things o f the world. S l e n d e r a n d G r a c e f u l W ith their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to hum ans and m em bers o f m any other races. They are slightly shorter than hum ans on average, ranging from w ell under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. T h ey are m ore slender than hum ans, w eigh in g only 100 to 145 pou nds. M ales and fem ales are about the sam e height, and m ales are only m arginally heavier than fem ales. E lves’ coloration en com p a sses the norm al hum an range and also includes skin in sh ades o f copper, bron ze, and alm ost bluish-white, hair o f green or blue, and eyes like p o o ls o f liquid gold or silver.

A T i m e l e s s P e r s p e c t i v e Elves can live w ell over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter- lived races m ore deeply. Th ey are m ore often am used than excited, and m ore likely to be cu riou s than greedy. They tend to rem ain a lo o f and unfazed by petty happenstance. W h en pursuing a goal, however, w hether adventuring on a m ission or learning a n ew skill or art, elves can be focu sed and relentless. They are slow to m ake friends and en em ies, and even slow er to forget them. T h ey reply to petty insults w ith disdain and to seriou s insults with vengean ce. Like the bran ches o f a youn g tree, elves are flexible in the face o f danger. T h ey trust in diplom acy and com p rom ise to resolve differences b efore they escalate to violence. T h ey have been kn ow n to retreat from intrusions into their w ood la n d h om es, confident that they can sim ply w ait the invaders out.

H i d d e n W o o d l a n d R e a l m s M ost elves dwell in sm all forest villages hidden am ong the trees. Elves hunt gam e, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and m agic allow them to support th em selves w ithout the n eed for clearin g and p low in g land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely w ork ed cloth es and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually lim ited, though a few elves m ake a g o o d living by trading crafted item s for m etals (w hich they have n o interest in m ining). Elves en cou ntered outside their ow n lands are com m on ly traveling m instrels, artists, or sages.

E x p l o r a t i o n a n d A d v e n t u r e Elves take up adventuring out o f w anderlust. S in ce they are s o long-lived, they can enjoy centuries o f exploration and discovery. They dislike the p a ce o f hum an society, w hich is regim ented from day to day but constantly changin g over d ecades, s o they find careers that let them travel freely and set their ow n pace. Elves also enjoy exercisin g their m artial p row ess or gaining greater m agical pow er, and adventuring allow s them to do so.

E l f N a m e s E lves are con sid ered children until they declare them selves adults, so m e tim e after the hundredth birthday, and before this p eriod they are called by child nam es. On declarin g adulthood, an elf selects an adult nam e, although th ose w h o k n ew him or her as a youngster m ight continue to u se the child nam e. E ach e lf’s adult nam e is a unique creation, though it m ight reflect the n am es o f resp ected individuals or other fam ily m em bers. Little distinction exists betw een m ale n am es and fem ale nam es; the grou pin gs h ere reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a fam ily nam e, typically a com bination o f other Elvish w ords.

And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.” Halflings. “ Halflings are people o f simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises." Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away— human endeavors seem so futile sometimes.

T h e D a r k n e s s o f t h e D r o w Were it not for one renowned exception, the race o f drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths o f the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination o f entire families as noble houses vie for position. Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world o f the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do'Urden, ranger o f the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender o f the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society o f their Underdark homes. Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end o f hatred. D a r k E l f ( D r o w ) D escen d ed from an earlier su brace o f dark-skinned elves, the d row w ere banished from the su rface w orld for follow in g the g o d d e ss Lolth dow n the path to evil and corruption.

Th ey com m on ly have very pale eyes (so pale as to b e m istaken for white) in sh ades o f lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. Th ey tend to be sm aller and thinner than m ost elves.

Regis was short, even by the standards of his diminutive race, with the fluff o f his curly brown locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface o f Maer Dualdon. —R.A. S a lvatore, The Crystal Shard liv e s : a p lace to s e ttle in p e a ce and quiet, far from m arauding m on sters and clashing arm ies; a blazing fire and a generous m eal; fine drink and fine conversation. T hough som e halflings live out their days in rem ote agricultural com m u n ities, others form n om ad ic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the w ide h orizon to d iscov er the w on d ers o f n ew lands and peop les. But even th ese w an derers love p ea ce, food, hearth, and hom e, though h om e m ight be a w agon jostlin g along an dirt road or a raft floating dow nriver. S m a l l a n d P r a c t i c a l T h e dim inutive halflings survive in a w orld full o f larger creatu res by avoiding n otice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively h arm less and s o have m anaged to survive for centuries in the sh ad ow o f em pires and on the edg es o f w ars and political strife. They are in clined to be stout, w eighing betw een 40 and 45 pounds. H alflings’ skin ran ges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually b row n or sandy brow n and wavy. T h ey have brow n or h azel eyes. H alfling m en often sport lon g sideburns, but bea rd s are rare am ong them and m ustaches even m ore so. They like to w ear sim ple, com fortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors. H alfling practicality extends beyon d their clothing. T h ey ’re c on cern ed w ith basic n eed s and sim ple p leasu res and have little u se for ostentation. Even the w ealthiest o f halflings keep their treasures lock ed in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. Th ey have a knack for finding the m ost straightforw ard solution to a problem , and have little patience for dithering. K i n d a n d C u r i o u s H alflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bon ds o f fam ily and friendship as well as the com forts o f hearth and hom e, h arboring few dream s o f gold or glory. Even adventurers am ong them usually venture into the w orld for reason s o f A f f a b l e a n d P o s i t i v e com m unity, friendship, w anderlust, or curiosity. They love d iscoverin g n ew things, even sim ple things, such as an exotic fo o d or an unfam iliar style o f clothing. H alflings are easily m oved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. Th ey are generous, happily sharing w hat they have even in lean tim es. B l e n d i n t o t h e C r o w d H alflings are adept at fitting into a com m u n ity o f hum ans, dw arves, or elves, m aking them selves valuable and w elcom e. T h e com bination o f their inherent stealth and their u nassum ing nature helps halflings to avoid unw anted attention. H alflings w ork readily w ith others, and they are loyal to their friends, w hether halfling or oth erw ise. Th ey can display rem arkable ferocity w hen their friends, fam ilies, or com m u n ities are threatened. P a s t o r a l P l e a s a n t r i e s M ost halflings live in sm all, p ea cefu l com m u n ities with large farm s and w ell-kept groves. They rarely build kin gdom s o f their ow n or even hold m uch land beyond their quiet shires. T h ey typically don ’t r ecog n ize any sort o f halfling nobility or royalty, instead look in g to fam ily elders to guide them. Fam ilies preserve their traditional w ays despite the rise and fall o f em pires. M any h alflings live am ong other races, w h ere the halflings’ hard w ork and loyal ou tlook offer them abundant rew ards and creature com forts. S o m e halfling com m u n ities travel as a w ay o f life, driving w ag on s or guiding boats from pla ce to place and m aintaining no perm anent hom e. Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations— especially negative ones. Dwarves. “ Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?” Elves. "They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out o f a wonderful dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling faces— surely more than they ever let on.” Humans. “ Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some o f them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you’ ll find good, solid folk. Not that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers— you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.” E x p l o r i n g O p p o r t u n i t i e s H alflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their com m u n ities, support their friends, or explore a w id e and w onder-filled w orld. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or som etim es a necessity. H a l f l i n g N a m e s A halfling has a given nam e, a fam ily nam e, and possibly a nicknam e.

Perhaps it is b eca u se o f their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as m uch as they can in the y ears they are given. Or m aybe they feel they have som eth in g to prove to the elder races, and that’s w hy they build their m ighty em pires on the foundation o f con q u est and trade. W hatever drives them, hum ans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pion eers o f the w orlds. A B r o a d S p e c t r u m W ith their penchant for m igration and conquest, hum ans are m ore physically diverse than other com m on races. T h ere is n o typical hum an. A n individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and w eigh from 125 to 250 pou nd s. H um an skin sh ades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair c o lo rs from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); m ales might sp ort facial hair that is sp arse or thick. A lot o f hum ans have a dash o f nonhum an blood, revealing hints o f elf, o r c , or other lineages. H um ans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century. V a r i e t y i n A l l T h i n g s H um ans are the m ost adaptable and am bitious p eople am ong the com m on races. Th ey have w idely varying tastes, m orals, and custom s in the m any different lands w here they have settled. W h en they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kin gdom s that can persist for long centuries. A n individual hum an m ight have a relatively short life span, but a hum an nation or culture p reserves traditions w ith origins far beyon d the reach o f any single hum an’s m em ory. They live fully in the present—m akin g them w ell suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, hum ans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changin g political and socia l dynam ics. E v e r y o n e ’s S e c o n d - B e s t F r i e n d s Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members o f other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries o f all kinds. Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.” Elves. “ It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don't like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.” Halflings. "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling— good food and good stories in front o f a nice, warm fire. If halflings had a shred o f ambition, they might really amount to something.” L a s t i n g I n s t i t u t i o n s W h ere a single elf or dw arf m ight take on the respon sibility o f guarding a sp ecia l location or a pow erfu l secret, hum ans found sacred orders and institutions for such p u rp oses. W h ile dw arf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each n ew generation, hum an tem ples, governm ents, libraries, and c o d e s o f law fix their traditions in the b e d ro ck o f history.

The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear him- self. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates o f Arush Vayem. father’s face was a skill she'd been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn’t spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar’s would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth—her father's face spoke volumes. But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still— the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh. —E rin M . Evans, The Adversary B orn o f dragons, as their nam e p roclaim s, the dragonborn w alk proudly through a w orld that greets them with fearful in com prehen sion . S h a ped by d racon ic g od s or the dragons them selves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bin in g the best attributes o f dragons and hum anoids. S o m e dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks o f soldiers in great w ars, and still others find them selves adrift, with no clear calling in life. P r o u d D r a g o n K i n D ragon born look very m uch like dragons standing erect in hum anoid form , though they lack w in gs or a tail. The first dragonborn had sca les o f vibrant hues m atching the colors o f their dragon kin, but generations o f interbreeding have created a m ore uniform appearance. Their sm all, fine sca les are usually brass or bron ze in color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. T h ey are tall and strongly built, often standing clo se to 6 1/2 feet tall and w eigh in g 3 0 0 pou nds or m ore. T heir hands and feet are strong, talonlike claw s w ith three fingers and a thum b on each hand. T h e b lood o f a particular type o f dragon runs very strong through so m e dragonborn clans. T h ese dragonborn often boast sca les that m ore closely m atch th ose o f their dragon a n cestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleam ing m etallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze. S e l f - S u f f i c i e n t C l a n s To any dragonborn , the clan is m ore im portant than life itself. D ragon born ow e their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragon b orn ’s con du ct reflects on the h on or o f his or her clan, and brin ging dishon or to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. E ach dragonborn k n ow s his or her station and duties w ithin the clan, and h on or dem ands m aintaining the b ou n ds o f that position. A continual drive for self-im provem ent reflects the self-sufficiency o f the race as a w hole. D ragon born value skill and excellen ce in all endeavors. T h ey hate to fail, and they push th em selves to extrem e efforts b efore they give up on som ething. A d ragonborn holds m astery o f a particular skill as a lifetim e goal. M em bers o f other races w h o share the sam e com m itm en t find it easy to earn the resp ect o f a dragonborn. T h ough all dragonborn strive to b e self-sufficient, they recog n ize that help is som etim es n eeded in difficult situations. But the best so u rce for such help is the clan, and w hen a clan n eeds help, it turns to another dragonborn clan b efore seek in g aid from other ra ce s— or even from the gods. D r a g o n b o r n N a m e s D ra gon born have person al n am es given at birth, but they put their clan n am es first as a m ark o f honor.

They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. In the cosmopolitan cities o f the D&D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren’t accustomed to seeing members o f these races, and they react accordingly. Dragonborn. It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear. Gnome. Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful. Half-Elf. Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger’s arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity. Half-Orc. It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out o f a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon. Tiefling. Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject o f supernatural fear. The evil o f their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.

Five types o f draconians, corresponding to the five types o f metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War o f the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver).

G n om es sp eak as if they ca n ’t get the thoughts out o f their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opin ion s on a range o f subjects, they still m anage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclam ations o f su rprise and appreciation along the way.

Like most hab- itations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could. But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep. —R ich a r d L ee Byers, The Black Bouquet A constant hum o f busy activity p ervades the w arren s and n eigh b orh ood s w h ere g n om es form their close- knit com m u n ities.

He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish against a warrior—provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half- orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn't last long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, and the strongest chief in Thar. —R ich a r d Baker, Swordmage exultation w h en they join in m elee com bat—and either exult along w ith him or shiver w ith fear and loathing.

That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with that wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you ? Like a little wildcat, I wager. Every little jab and comment just sharpens your claws.” —E rin M . Evans, Brimstone Angels To be greeted with stares and w h ispers, to suffer violen ce and insult on the street, to see m istrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot o f the tiefling. And to tw ist the knife, tieflings kn ow that this is b eca u se a pact stru ck generations ago in fused the e ss e n ce o f A s m od eu s—overlord o f the Nine H ells—into their bloodlin e. Th eir appearan ce and their nature are not their fault but the result o f an ancient sin, for w hich they and their children and their children ’s children w ill always b e held accountable. I n f e r n a l B l o o d l i n e Tieflings are derived from hum an blood lin es, and in the broadest p ossib le sen se, they still look hum an. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear im print on their appearan ce. T ieflings have large h orns that take any o f a variety o f shapes: som e have curling h orn s like a ram, others have straight and tall h orn s like a g azelle’s, and som e spiral upw ard like an an telopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, w hich lash or coil around their legs w hen they get upset or n ervous. Their can in e teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid c o lo r s —black, red, white, silver, or gold—w ith no visible sclera or pupil. Th eir skin tones cover the full range o f hum an coloration, but also include various sh ades o f red. Their hair, ca sca d in g dow n from behind their h orns, is usually dark, from black o r brow n to dark red, blue, or purple. S e l f - R e l i a n t a n d S u s p i c i o u s Tieflings subsist in sm all m inorities found m ostly in hum an cities or tow ns, often in the roughest quarters o f th ose places, w here they g row up to be sw indlers, thieves, or crim e lords. S om etim es they live am ong other m inority populations in en claves w h ere they are treated w ith m ore respect. L ackin g a hom eland, tieflings k n ow that they have to m ake their ow n w ay in the w orld and that they have to b e strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone w h o claim s to b e a friend, but w hen a tiefling’s com p a n ion s dem onstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the sam e trust to them. A n d on ce a tiefling gives som eon e loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life. T i e f l i n g N a m e s Tiefling n am es fall into three broad categories. Tieflings b orn into another culture typically have n am es reflective o f that culture. S o m e have n am es derived from the Infernal language, p a ssed dow n through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. A n d som e younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the w orld, adopt a nam e that signifies a virtue or other con cep t and then try to em b od y that con cept. For som e, the ch osen nam e is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.

Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years o f dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.

T h ese barbarians, different as they m ight be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. M ore than a m ere em otion, their anger is the ferocity o f a corn ered predator, the unrelenting assault o f a storm , the churning turm oil o f the sea. F or som e, their rage springs from a com m u n ion with fierce anim al spirits. O thers draw from a roiling reservoir o f anger at a w orld full o f pain. For every barbarian, rage is a p ow er that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats o f strength. P r i m a l I n s t i n c t P eop le o f tow n s and cities take pride in h ow their civilized w ays set them apart from anim als, as if denying on e’s o w n nature w as a m ark o f superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign o f w eak n ess. T h e stron g em b ra ce their anim al n a tu r e - keen instincts, prim al physicality, and ferociou s rage. B arbarians are u ncom fortable w hen h edged in by w alls and crow ds. They thrive in the w ild s o f their hom elands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslan ds w here their tribes live and hunt. Barbarians co m e alive in the ch a os o f com bat. They can enter a b erserk state w here rage takes over, giving them superhum an strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir o f fury only a few tim es w ithout resting, but th ose few rages are usually sufficient to defeat w hatever threats arise. A L i f e o f D a n g e r Not every m em ber o f the tribes deem ed “barbarians” by scion s o f civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian am ong these p eople is as u n com m on as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a sim ilar role as a p rotector o f the p eople and a leader in tim es o f war. Life in the w ild places o f the w orld is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying m onsters. Barbarians charge h eadlong into that danger s o that their p eople d on ’t have to. T h eir cou rage in the face o f danger m akes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. W andering is often a w ay o f life for their native tribes, and the rootless life o f the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. S om e barbarians m iss the close-k n it fam ily stru ctu res o f the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bon ds form ed am ong the m em bers o f their adventuring parties. C r e a t i n g a B a r b a r i a n W h en creating a barbarian character, think about w here you r character c o m e s from and his or her place in the w orld. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. D id you co m e from a distant land, m akin g you a stranger in the area o f the cam paign? O r is the cam paign set in a rough-and-tum ble frontier w here barbarians are com m on ? W hat led you to take up the adventuring life? W ere you lured to settled lands by the prom ise o f rich es? Did you jo in forces w ith soldiers o f those lands to face a shared threat? D id m on sters or an invading horde drive you out o f your hom eland, m akin g you a rootless refugee? Perhaps y ou w ere a prison er o f war, brought in chains to “civilized ” lands and only n ow able to w in your freedom . Or you might have been cast out from your p eople b eca u se o f a crim e you com m itted, a ta boo you violated, or a cou p that rem oved you from a position o f authority.

A s norm al, you ca n ’t in crease an ability sco re above 20 using this feature.

F e r a l I n s t i n c t By 7th level, your instincts are so h oned that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are su rprised at the begin ning o f com bat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act n orm ally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doin g anything else on that turn. B r u t a l C r i t i c a l B egin ning at 9th level, you ca n roll one additional w eap on dam age die w hen determ ining the extra dam age for a critical hit w ith a m elee attack.

R e l e n t l e s s R a g e Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous w ou n ds. If you drop to 0 hit points w hile y ou ’re raging and don ’t die outright, you can m ake a D C 10 Constitution saving throw. If you su cceed , you drop to 1 hit point instead. E ach tim e you use this feature after the first, the D C in creases by 5. W h en you finish a short or long rest, the D C resets to 10. barbarians attribute their rage to different sou rces, however. F or som e, it is an internal reservoir w here pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. O thers se e it as a spiritual blessing, a gift o f a totem anim al. P a t h o f t h e B e r s e r k e r For som e barbarians, rage is a m eans to an end-—that end being violen ce. The Path o f the B erserker is a path o f untram m eled fury, slick w ith blood. A s you enter the berserk er’s rage, you thrill in the ch a os o f battle, h eed less o f your ow n health or w ell-being. F r e n z y Starting w hen you c h o o s e this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy w hen you rage. If you do so, for the duration o f your rage you can m ake a single m elee w eapon attack as a bon u s action on each o f your turns after this one. W h en your rage ends, you suffer on e level o f exhaustion (as d escribed in appendix A). M i n d l e s s R a g e B egin ning at 6th level, you ca n ’t be ch a rm ed or frightened w hile raging. If you are charm ed or frightened w hen you enter your rage, the effect is su sp ended for the duration o f the rage. I n t i m i d a t i n g P r e s e n c e B egin ning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten som eon e w ith your m en acin g p resen ce. W h en you do so, c h o o s e on e creature that you can see w ithin 30 feet o f you. If the creature can see or hear you, it m ust su cce e d on a W isd om saving th row (D C equal to 8 + your p roficiency bon u s + your Charism a m odifier) or b e frightened o f you until the end o f your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration o f this effect on the frightened P e r s i s t e n t R a g e creature until the end o f your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out o f line o f sight or m ore than 60 feet away from you. If the creature su cce e d s on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. R e t a l i a t i o n Starting at 14th level, w hen you take dam age from a creature that is within 5 feet o f you. you can use your reaction to m ake a m elee w eap on attack against that creature. P a t h o f t h e T o t e m W a r r i o r The Path o f the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accep ts a spirit anim al as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding m agical fuel to your barbarian rage. M ost barbarian tribes con sid er a totem anim al to be kin to a particular clan. In such ca ses, it is unusual for an individual to have m ore than one totem anim al spirit, though exception s exist. S p i r i t S e e k e r Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural w orld, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level w hen you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10. T o t e m S p i r i t At 3rd level, w hen you adopt this path, you c h o o s e a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must m ake or acquire a physical totem object- an am ulet or sim ilar adornm ent—that in corporates fur or feathers, claw s, teeth, or b on es o f the totem anim al. At your option, you also gain m inor physical attributes that are rem iniscent o f your totem spirit. For exam ple, if you have a bear totem spirit, you m ight be unusually hairy and thick- skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. Your totem anim al m ight be an anim al related to th ose listed here but m ore appropriate to your hom eland. F or exam ple, you cou ld c h o o s e a hawk or vulture in place o f an eagle. Bear. W h ile raging, you have resistan ce to all dam age except p sych ic dam age. The spirit o f the bea r m akes you tough enough to stand up to any punishm ent. Eagle. W h ile you're raging and aren’t w earin g heavy armor, other creatu res have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can u se the D ash action as a bonus action on your turn. T h e spirit o f the eagle m a k es you into a predator w h o can w eave through the fray with ease. Wolf, W h ile you're raging, your friends have advantage on m elee attack rolls against any creature w ithin 5 feet o f you that is hostile to you. The spirit o f the w o lf m akes you a leader o f hunters. A s p e c t o f t h e B e a s t At 6th level, you gain a m agical benefit based on the totem anim al o f your ch oice. You can c h o o s e the sam e anim al you selected at 3rd level or a different one. Bear. You gain the m ight o f a bear. Your carryin g capacity (including m axim um load and m axim um lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength ch eck s m ade to push, pull, lift, or break objects. Eagle. You gain the eyesight o f an eagle. You can s e e up to 1 m ile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though look in g at som eth in g no m ore than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't im p ose disadvantage on your W isd om (P erception ) ch ecks. Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities o f a w olf. You can track other creatu res w hile traveling at a fast pace, and you can m ove stealthily w hile traveling at a norm al pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace). S p i r i t W a l k e r At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a ritual. W h en you do so, a spiritual version o f one o f the anim als you c h ose for Totem Spirit or A sp ect o f the B east appears to you to convey the inform ation you seek. T o t e m i c A t t u n e m e n t At 14th level, you gain a m agical benefit ba sed on a totem anim al o f your ch oice. You can c h o o s e the sam e anim al you selected previously or a different one. Bear, W h ile you ’re raging, any creature within 5 feet o f you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enem y is im m u ne to this effect if it ca n ’t see or hear you or if it ca n ’t b e frightened. Eagle. W h ile raging, you have a flying sp eed equal to your current w alk in g speed. T h is benefit w ork s only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is h oldin g you aloft. Wolf. W h ile y ou ’re raging, you can u se a bon u s action on your turn to kn ock a Large or sm aller creature prone w hen you hit it with m elee w eapon attack. In the w orlds o f D&D, w ord s and m usic are not just vibrations o f air, but v ocalization s with p ow er all their ow n. The bard is a m aster o f song, sp eech , and the m a gic they contain. B ards say that the m ultiverse w a s spoken into existence, that the w ord s o f the g od s gave it shape, and that e c h o e s o f these prim ordial W ords o f Creation still resou n d throughout the c o sm o s . The m u sic o f bards is an attempt to snatch and h arness th ose ech oes, subtly w oven into their sp ells and pow ers. The greatest strength o f bards is their sheer versatility. M any bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in com bat, using their m agic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable o f defending them selves in m elee if necessary, using their m agic to bolster their sw ord s and armor. Their spells lean tow ard ch a rm s and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a w ide-ranging k n ow led ge o f m any su bjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do alm ost anything w ell. B ards b e co m e m asters o f the talents they set their m inds to perfecting, from m u sical p erform a n ce to esoteric know ledge. L e a r n i n g f r o m E x p e r i e n c e True bards are not com m on in the w orld. Not every m instrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal cou rt is a bard. D iscoverin g the m agic hidden in m usic requires hard study and som e m easure o f natural talent that m ost troubadours and jon g leu rs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference betw een these perform ers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent w andering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude o f audiences, m uch like any other entertainer. But a depth o f know ledge, a level o f m usical skill, and a touch o f m agic set bards apart from their fellow s. Only rarely do bards settle in on e place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find n ew tales to tell, n ew skills to learn, and new discov eries beyon d the h orizon —m akes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportu nity to learn, practice a variety o f skills, enter long-forgotten tom bs, d iscov er lost B a r d H u m m ing as she traces her fingers over an ancient m onum ent in a long-forgotten ruin, a h alf-elf in rugged leathers finds k n ow led ge sprin ging into her mind, con ju red forth by the m agic o f her son g —kn ow ledge o f the p eople w h o con stru cted the m onum ent and the m ythic saga it depicts.

A bard w h o can tell an aw e-inspiring story from person al experien ce earn s renow n am ong other bards. Indeed, after telling s o m any stories about h eroes accom plish in g m ighty d eeds, m any bards take these th em es to heart and assu m e h eroic roles them selves.

Your character’s back grou n d and m otivations are not as im portant as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secu re and m undane ch ildh ood . T h ere’s no g o o d story to be told about that, so you m ight paint y ou rself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dism al sw am p. Or your ch ild h ood m ight be w orthy o f a story.

B a r d C o l l e g e s Th e w ay o f a bard is gregarious. B ards seek each other out to sw ap so n g s and stories, boast o f their a ccom plish m en ts, and share their kn ow ledge. Bards form lo o s e association s, w hich they call colleg es, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions. C o l l e g e o f L o r e B ards o f the C ollege o f L ore k n ow som eth in g about m ost things, collectin g bits o f k n ow led ge from sou rces as diverse as scholarly tom es and peasant tales. W h eth er singin g folk ballads in taverns or elaborate com p osition s in royal courts, th ese bards u se their gifts to hold au dien ces spellbou n d. W h en the applause dies dow n, the audience m em bers m ight find them selves qu estion in g everything they held to be true, from their faith in the p riesth ood o f the loca l tem ple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty o f th ese bards lies in the pursuit o f beauty and truth, not in fealty to a m on arch or follow in g the tenets o f a deity. A n oble w h o keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor k n ow s that the bard w ou ld rather be h onest than politic. The co lle g e ’s m em bers gather in libraries and som etim es in actual colleg es, com plete w ith cla ssroom s and dorm itories, to share their lore w ith one another. T h ey also m eet at festivals or affairs o f state, w here they can ex p o se corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self- im portant figures o f authority.

You can c h o o s e to use this feature after the creature m akes its roll, but before the DM determ ines w hether the attack roll or ability ch eck su cceed s or fails, or before the creature deals its dam age. The creature is im m une if it can ’t hear you or if it’s im m une to being charm ed. A d d i t i o n a l M a g i c a l S e c r e t s At 6th level, you learn tw o spells o f your ch oice from any class. A spell you c h o o s e m ust be o f a level you can cast, as sh ow n on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

C lerics are interm ediaries b etw een the m ortal w orld and the distant planes o f the gods. A s varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to em b ody the h andiw ork o f their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is im bued with divine m agic. H e a l e r s a n d W a r r i o r s Divine m agic, as the nam e suggests, is the p ow er o f the gods, flow ing from them into the w orld. C lerics are conduits for that pow er, m anifesting it as m iracu lou s effects. The gods d on ’t grant this p ow er to everyone w h o seek s it, but only to th ose c h osen to fulfill a high calling. H arn essin g divine m agic d oesn ’t rely on study or training. A cleric m ight learn form ulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sen se o f a deity’s w ishes. C lerics com bin e the helpful m agic o f healing and inspiring their allies with sp ells that harm and hinder foes. Th ey can provoke awe and dread, lay c u rses o f plague or poison, and even call dow n flam es from heaven to con su m e their en em ies.

In som e cities, p riesth ood am ounts to a political office, view ed as a stepping stone to higher position s o f authority and involving n o com m u n ion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in m ost hierarchies. W h en a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually b eca u se his or her g od dem an ds it. P u rsuing the goals o f the g od s often involves braving dangers beyon d the w alls o f civilization, sm iting evil or seek in g holy relics in ancient tom bs.

It also grants you additional w ays to use Channel Divinity w hen you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. D o m a i n S p e l l s E ach dom ain has a list o f sp ells—its dom ain sp ells— that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the dom ain description. O nce you gain a dom ain spell, you always have it prepared, and it d oesn ’t coun t against the num ber o f spells you ca n prepare each day. If you have a dom ain spell that d oesn ’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine en ergy directly from your deity, using that en ergy to fuel m agical effects. You start with tw o such effects: Turn U ndead and an effect determ ined by your dom ain. S om e dom ain s grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the dom ain description. W h en you u se your Channel Divinity, you c h o o s e w hich effect to create. You m ust then finish a short or lon g rest to u se your Channel Divinity again.

T h e DM c h o o s e s the nature o f the intervention; the effect o f any cleric spell or cleric dom ain spell w ou ld be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you ca n ’t u se this feature again for 7 days. O therw ise, you can use it again after you finish a lon g rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention su cce e d s automatically, n o roll required. D i v i n e D o m a i n s In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different asp ects o f m ortal life and civilization, called a deity’s dom ain.

For exam ple, the portfolio o f the G reek god A p ollo includes the dom ain s o f K now ledge, Life, and Light. A s a cleric, you c h o o s e on e aspect o f your deity’s portfolio to em phasize, and you are granted p ow ers related to that dom ain.

W h eth er calling on the elem ental forces o f nature or em ulating the creatu res o f the anim al w orld, druids are an em bodim ent o f nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim n o m astery over nature. Instead, they see them selves as exten sion s o f nature’s indom itable will. P o w e r o f N a t u r e D ruids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other m agical p ow ers either from the force o f nature itself or from a nature deity. M any druids pursue a m ystic spirituality o f transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, w hile others serve g od s o f w ild nature, anim als, or elem ental forces. Th e ancient druidic traditions are som etim es called the Old Faith, in contrast to the w orship o f g od s in tem ples and shrines. D ruid sp ells are oriented tow ard nature and an im als— the p ow er o f tooth and claw, o f sun and m oon , o f fire and storm . D ruids also gain the ability to take on anim al form s, and som e druids m ake a particular study o f this practice, even to the point w h ere they prefer anim al form to their natural form . P r e s e r v e t h e B a l a n c e F or druids, nature exists in a preca riou s balance. The four elem ents that m ake up a w orld —air, earth, fire, and w ater—must rem ain in equilibrium . If on e elem ent w ere to gain p ow er over the others, the w orld cou ld be destroyed, draw n into on e o f the elem ental planes and broken apart into its com p on en t elem ents. Thus, druids o p p o s e cults o f Elem ental Evil and others w h o prom ote one elem ent to the exclusion o f others. D ruids are also con cern ed with the delicate ecologica l balance that sustains plant and anim al life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harm ony with nature, not in opposition to it. D ruids a ccept that w h ich is cru el in nature, and they hate that w h ich is unnatural, including aberrations (such as b eh olders and m ind flayers) and undead (such as zom b ies and vam pires). D ruids som etim es lead raids against such creatures, especially w hen the m on sters en croach on the druids’ territory. D ruids are often found guarding sacred sites or w atching over region s o f u nspoiled nature. But w hen a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a m ore active role in com ba tin g the threat, as adventurers. C r e a t i n g a D r u i d W h en m aking a druid, con sid er w hy your character has such a clo se bon d with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society w h ere the Old Faith still thrives, or w as raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths o f a forest. Perhaps your character had a dram atic en cou nter with the spirits o f nature, com in g face to face with a giant eagle or dire w o lf and surviving the experience. M aybe your character w a s born during an epic storm or a volca n ic eruption, w hich w as interpreted as a sign that b e co m in g a druid w as part o f your character’s destiny. Have you always been an adventurer as part o f your druidic calling, or did you first sp en d tim e as a caretaker o f a sacred grove or sprin g? Perhaps your h om eland w as befou led by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in h op es o f finding a new h om e or pu rpose.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths o f oak or yew or sprigs o f mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid o f a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. one spell). The sp ells must be o f a level for w hich you have spell slots.

A r c h d r u i d At 20th level, you can u se your W ild S h a p e an unlim ited num ber o f tim es. T i m e l e s s B o d y Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and som atic com p on en ts o f your druid spells, as w ell as any material com pon en ts that lack a cost and aren’t con su m ed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your norm al shape and your beast shape from W ild Shape. D r u i d C ir c l e s Though their organization is invisible to m ost outsiders, druids are part o f a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nom inally m em bers o f this druidic society, though som e individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking m em bers o f the society or participated in druidic gatherings. D ruids recog n ize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures o f the w ilderness, however, druids som etim es com pete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the w ay o f the druid. C i r c l e o f t h e L a n d The Circle o f the Land is m ade up o f m ystics and sages w h o safeguard ancient kn ow led ge and rites through a vast oral tradition. T h ese druids m eet w ithin sacred circles o f trees or standing ston es to w h isper prim al secrets in D ruidic. T h e circle’s w isest m em bers preside as the ch ief priests o f com m u n ities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers o f th ose folk. A s a m em ber o f this circle, your m agic is influenced by the land w here you w ere initiated into the circle’s m ysterious rites. B o n u s C a n t r i p W h en you c h o o s e this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip o f your choice. N a t u r a l R e c o v e r y Starting at 2nd level, you can regain som e o f your m agical en ergy by sitting in m editation and com m u n in g w ith nature. D uring a short rest, you c h o o s e expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a com b in ed level that is equal to or less than h alf your druid level (rounded up), and n one o f the slots can be 6 th level or higher. You can ’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest For exam ple, w hen you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to tw o levels w orth o f spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or tw o 1st-level slots. C i r c l e S p e l l s Your m ystical con n ection to the land in fu ses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain a c c e s s to circle spells con n ected to the land w here you b e ca m e a druid. C h oose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, sw am p, or U nderdark—and consult the associated list o f spells. O nce you gain a c c e s s to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it d o e s n ’t coun t against the num ber o f spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a c c e s s to a spell that d oesn ’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is n onetheless a druid spell for you.

You can also pa ss through n onm agical plants w ithout being slow ed by them and w ithout taking dam age from them if they have thorns, spines, or a sim ilar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to im pede m ovem ent, such th ose created by the entangle spell. N a t u r e ’s W a r d W h en you reach 10th level, you c a n ’t be ch arm ed or frightened by elem entals or fey, and you are im m u ne to p oison and disease. N a t u r e ’s S a n c t u a r y W h en you reach 14th level, creatures o f the natural w orld sen se your con n ection to nature and b e c o m e hesitant to attack you. W h en a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature m ust m ake a W isd om saving th row against your druid spell save D C. On a failed save, the creature m ust c h o o s e a different target, or the attack autom atically m isses. O n a su ccessfu l save, the creature is im m une to this effect for 24 hours. T h e creature is aw are o f this effect before it m akes its attack against you. C i r c l e o f t h e M o o n D ruids o f the Circle o f the M oon are fierce guardians o f the w ilds. Th eir order gathers under the full m oon to share n ew s and trade w arnings. They haunt the deepest parts o f the w ildern ess, w here they might go for w eek s on end before crossin g paths w ith another hum anoid creature, let alone another druid. C hangeable as the m oon , a druid o f this circle might prow l as a great cat on e night, soa r over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrow th in bea r form to drive off a trespassing m onster. The w ild is in the druid's blood. C o m b a t W i l d S h a p e W h en you c h o o s e this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to u se W ild Sh ape on your turn as a bon u s action, rather than as an action. Additionally, w hile you are transform ed by W ild Shape, you ca n u se a bon u s action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level o f the spell slot expended. C i r c l e F o r m s T h e rites o f y ou r circle grant you the ability to transform into m ore dangerou s anim al form s. Starting at 2nd level, you can u se your W ild Sh ape to transform into a beast with a challen ge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the M ax. C R colum n o f the B east S h apes table, but must abide by the other lim itations there). Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast w ith a challen ge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded dow n. P r i m a l St r i k e Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as m agical for the p u rp ose o f ov ercom in g resistan ce and im m unity to n onm agical attacks and dam age. E l e m e n t a l W i l d S h a p e At 10th level, you can expend tw o u ses o f W ild Sh ape at the sam e tim e to transform into an air elem ental, an earth elem ental, a fire elem ental, or a water elem ental. T h o u s a n d F o r m s By 14th level, you have learned to use m agic to alter your physical form in m ore subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will. D r u i d s a n d t h e G o d s Some druids venerate the forces o f nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one o f the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists o f gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship o f these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths o f clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship o f Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship o f Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees o f Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa. In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith o f a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods o f Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy o f veneration. The druids o f Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon— sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces o f civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children o f Winter venerate the forces o f death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion o f aberrations. F i g h t e r A hum an in clan ging plate arm or holds her shield b efore her as she run s tow ard the m a ssed goblins. A n elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblin s w ith arrow s lo o s e d from his exquisite bow .

All o f these h eroes are fighters, perhaps the m ost diverse cla ss o f characters in the w orld s o f D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s .

A nd they are w ell acquainted w ith death, both m eting it out and staring it defiantly in the face. W e l l - R o u n d e d S p e c i a l i s t s Fighters learn the b a sics o f all com bat styles. Every fighter can sw in g an axe, fen ce with a rapier, w ield a lon gsw ord or a greatsw ord, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with som e degree o f skill. Likew ise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form o f armor. Beyond that basic degree o f familiarity, each fighter sp ecia lizes in a certain style o f com bat. S o m e concentrate on archery, som e on fighting w ith tw o w ea p on s at on ce, and som e on augm enting their m artial skills w ith m agic. This com bination o f broad general ability and extensive specialization m akes fighters su perior com batants on battlefields and in du ngeon s alike. T r a i n e d f o r D a n g e r Not every m em ber o f the city watch, the village militia, or the qu een ’s arm y is a fighter. M ost o f these troop s are relatively untrained soldiers w ith only the m ost basic com bat kn ow ledge. Veteran soldiers, m ilitary officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and sim ilar figures are fighters. S o m e fighters feel draw n to use their training as adventurers. The du ngeon delving, m on ster slaying, and other dangerou s w ork c o m m o n am ong adventurers is se co n d nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. T h ere are greater risks, perhaps, but also m uch greater rew ards—few fighters in the city w atch have the opportunity to d iscover a m agic flame tongue sw ord, for exam ple. C r e a t i n g a F i g h t e r A s you build your fighter, think about tw o related elem ents o f your character's backgrou n d: W h ere did you get your com bat training, and w hat set you apart from the m undane w arriors around you? W ere you particularly ruthless? D id you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps b eca u se o f your exception al dedication? W hat drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to y ou r hom eland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove y ou rself m ight all have b een factors. You m ight have enjoyed form al training in a n oble’s arm y or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a w ar academ y, learning strategy, tactics, and m ilitary history. O r you m ight be self-taught—unpolish ed but w ell tested. Did you take up the sw ord as a w ay to esca p e the lim its o f life on a farm , or are you follow in g a p roud fam ily tradition? W h ere did you acquire your w ea p on s and arm or? T h ey m ight have been m ilitary issue or fam ily h eirloom s, or perhaps you scrim p ed and saved for years to buy them.

M a n e u v e r s T h e m aneuvers are presen ted in alphabetical order. Commander’s Strike. W h en you take the Attack action on you r turn, you can forgo on e o f your attacks and u se a bon u s action to direct on e o f your com pa n ion s to strike.

You add the superiority die to the attack’s dam age roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is m ade before the start o f y ou r next turn. Evasive Footwork. W h en you m ove, you ca n expend on e superiority die, rolling the die and adding the num ber rolled to your AC until you stop moving. Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die and use a bon u s action on your turn to feint, ch oosin g one creature w ithin 5 feet o f you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s dam age roll. Goading Attack. W h en you hit a creature w ith a w eap on attack, you can expend on e superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

You add the superiority die to the attack’s dam age roll, and the target must m ake a W isd om saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened o f you until the en d o f your next turn. Parry. W h en another creature dam ages you w ith a m elee attack, you can u se your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the dam age by the num ber you roll on your superiority die + your D exterity m odifier. Precision Attack. W h en you m ake a w eapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can u se this m aneuver before or after m akin g the attack roll, but before any effects o f the attack are applied. Pushing Attack. W h en you hit a creatu re with a w ea p on attack, you ca n expend on e su periority die to attem pt to drive the target back.

O p p o r t u n i s t At 17th level, you can exploit a creatu re's m om entary distraction w hen it is hit by an attack.

W h en you focu s your ki, you can align y ou rself w ith the fo r ce s o f creation and ben d the four elem ents to your w ill, using them as an extension o f your body. S om e m em bers o f this tradition dedicate them selves to a single elem ent, but others w eave the elem ents together. M any m on k s o f this tradition tattoo their b o d ie s with representations o f their ki pow ers, com m on ly im agined as coilin g dragons, but also as ph oenixes, fish, plants, m ountains, and crestin g w aves. D i s c i p l e o f t h e E l e m e n t s W h en you c h o o s e this tradition at 3rd level, you learn m agical disciplin es that h arness the p ow er o f the four elem ents.

You k n ow the E lem ental Attunem ent discipline and on e other elem ental discipline o f your choice, w hich are detailed in the “Elem ental D iscip lin es” section below. You learn on e additional elem ental discipline o f your ch oice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. W h enever you learn a n ew elem ental discipline, you can also replace on e elem ental discipline that you already k n ow w ith a different discipline. Casting Elemental Spells.

O n ce you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to in crease the level o f an elem ental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an en hanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level in creases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For exam ple, if you are a 5th-level m on k and use S w eep in g Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the disciplin e’s ba se cost o f 2 ki points plus 1). T h e m axim u m num ber o f ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this w ay (including its ba se ki point cost and any additional ki poin ts you sp en d to in crease its level) is determ ined by your m on k level, as sh ow n in the S p ells and Ki Points table.

In lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east o f the Forgotten Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines o f the monk. Some o f these monasteries have spread to the western lands o f Faerun, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate. Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value o f physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order o f the Dark Moon is made up o f monks dedicated to Shar (goddess o f loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries o f Ilmater (god o f endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names o f great heroes o f the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study o f martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities o f the Sovereign Host. In the world o f Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god o f meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess o f twilight and the superiority o f mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery. The evil monks o f the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles o f their nation and their race— the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world.

His sp ear flashes like his eyes as he ja b s again and again at a tw isted giant, until at last his light ov ercom es its h ideou s darkness. W hatever their origin and their m ission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces o f evil. W h eth er sw orn before a g od ’s altar and the w itn ess o f a priest, in a sa cred glade b efore nature spirits and fey beings, or in a m om ent o f desperation and g rief w ith the dead as the only w itn ess, a paladin’s oath is a pow erfu l bond. It is a so u rce o f p ow er that turns a devout w arrior into a blessed cham pion. T h e C a u s e o f R i g h t e o u s n e s s A paladin sw ea rs to uphold ju stice and righteousness, to stand w ith the g o o d things o f the w orld against the en croach in g darkness, and to hunt the forces o f evil w herever they lurk. Different paladins focu s on various aspects o f the cau se o f righ teou sn ess, but all are b ou n d by the oaths that grant them p ow er to d o their sa cred w ork. A lthough m any paladins are devoted to g od s o f g ood , a paladin’s p ow er c o m e s as m uch from a com m itm en t to ju stice itself as it d o e s from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills o f com bat, m astering a variety o f w ea p on s and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secon d a ry to the m agical p ow er they w ield: p ow er to heal the sick and injured, to sm ite the w ick ed and the undead, and to protect the innocent and th ose w h o join them in the fight for ju stice. B e y o n d t h e M u n d a n e L i f e A lm ost by definition, the life o f a paladin is an adventuring life.

Fighters are rare enough a m on g the ranks o f the m ilitias and arm ies o f the w orld, but even few er p eople can claim the true calling o f a paladin. W h en they do receive the call, these w arriors turn from their form er occu p ation s and take up arm s to fight evil. S om etim es their oaths lead them into the serv ice o f the crow n as leaders o f elite grou ps o f knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the ca u se o f righ teou sn ess, not to crow n and country. Adventuring p aladins take their w ork seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher p u rp ose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in du ngeon s and prim eval forests, and even the sm allest victory against it can tilt the c o s m ic ba la n ce away from oblivion. C r e a t i n g a P a l a d i n Th e m ost im portant aspect o f a paladin character is the nature o f his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that ch oice by reading the oath descriptions at the end o f the class. A re you a devoted servant o f g ood, loyal to the gods o f ju stice and honor, a holy knight in shining arm or venturing forth to sm ite evil?

H ow did you exp erien ce your call to serve as a paladin? D id you hear a w h isper from an u n seen g od or angel w hile you w ere at prayer? D id another paladin sen se the potential w ithin you and d ecide to train you as a squire? Or did som e terrible event—the destruction o f your h om e, perhaps— drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stum bled into a sa cred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found y ou rself called to protect all such refuges o f g o od n ess and beauty. O r you m ight have k n ow n from your earliest m em ories that the paladin’s life w as your calling, alm ost as if you had been sent into the w orld w ith that p u rp ose stam ped on your soul. A s guardians against the forces o f w ick ed n ess, paladins are rarely o f any evil alignm ent. M ost o f them w alk the paths o f charity and ju stice.

W ith a C harism a o f 14, your list o f prepared spells can include four spells o f 1st or 2nd level, in any com bination.

T h e extra dam age is 2d 8 for a 1st-level sp ell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a m axim u m o f 5d8. T h e dam age in creases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

S a c r e d O a t h W h en you reach 3rd level, you sw ear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this tim e you have been in a preparatory stage, com m itted to the path but not yet sw orn to it. N ow you c h o o s e the Oath o f D evotion, the Oath o f the Ancients, or the Oath o f V engeance, all detailed at the end o f the class description. Your ch oice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. T h o se features include oath sp ells and the Channel Divinity feature. O a t h S p e l l s E ach oath has a list o f a ssocia ted spells. You gain a c c e s s to th ese spells at the levels sp ecified in the oath description. O n ce you gain a c c e ss to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells d on ’t count against the num ber o f spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that d oesn ’t appear on the paladin sp ell list, the spell is n onetheless a paladin spell for you. C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y Your oath allow s you to channel divine en ergy to fuel m agical effects. E ach Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains h ow to u se it. W h en you u se your Channel Divinity, you ch o o s e w hich option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to u se your Channel Divinity again. S o m e Channel Divinity effects require saving throw s. W h en you u se such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t W h en you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can in crease on e ability s c o r e o f your ch oice by 2, or you can in crease tw o ability sc o r e s o f your ch oice by 1.

W h en ever you hit a creature with a m elee w eapon , the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant dam age. If you also u se your D ivine Sm ite with an attack, you add this dam age to the extra dam age o f your D ivine Sm ite. C l e a n s i n g T o u c h B egin ning at 14th level, you can use your action to end on e spell on y ou rself or on on e w illing creature that you touch.

Sa c r e d O a t h s B ecom in g a paladin involves taking v ow s that com m it the paladin to the cau se o f righ teou sn ess, an active path o f fighting w ick ed n ess. The final oath, taken w hen he or sh e reach es 3rd level, is the culm ination o f all the paladin’s training. S o m e characters with this class d on ’t con sider them selves true paladins until they have reach ed 3rd level and m ade this oath. For others, the actual sw earin g o f the oath is a formality, an official stam p on w hat has always been true in the paladin’s heart. O a t h o f D e v o t i o n T h e Oath o f D evotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals o f ju stice, virtue, and order. S om etim es called cavaliers, w hite knights, or holy w arriors, these paladins m eet the ideal o f the knight in sh in in g armor, acting w ith h on or in pursuit o f ju stice and the greater good. Th ey h old th em selves to the highest standards of conduct, and som e, for better or w orse, hold the rest o f the w orld to the sam e standards. M any w ho sw ear this oath are devoted to gods o f law and g o o d and use their g od s’ tenets as the m easu re o f their devotion.

T e n e t s o f D e v o t i o n T h ou gh the exact w ord s and strictures o f the Oath o f D evotion vary, paladins o f this oath share these tenets. Honesty. D on ’t lie or cheat.

B r e a k i n g Y o u r O a t h A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards o f conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser o f two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign o f penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act o f self-denial. After a rite o f confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign o f repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the D u n ge o n M aste r's Guide. reactions.

S o m e sorcerers w ield m agic that springs from an ancient b loodlin e in fused with the m agic o f dragons.

S o m e d racon ic b lood lin es produce exactly on e sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines o f d escen t every individual is a sorcerer. M ost o f the tim e, the talents o f sorcery appear as apparent flukes. S o m e sorcerers ca n ’t nam e the origin o f their pow er, w hile others trace it to strange events in their ow n lives.

Y o u r Pa c t B o o n Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature. Pact o f the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection o f your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. Pact o f the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made o f black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. Pact o f the Tome. Your Book o f Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells o f enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary o f a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps o f spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. O t h e r w o r l d l y P a t r o n s T h e beings that serve as patrons for w arlock s are m ighty inhabitants o f other planes o f ex isten ce—not gods, but alm ost godlike in their pow er. V arious patrons give their w arlock s a c c e s s to different p ow ers and invocations, and ex p ect significant favors in return. S om e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out m ystic kn ow led ge relatively freely o r boastin g o f their ability to bind m ortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their p ow er only grudgingly, and might m ake a pact with only one w arlock. W arlocks w h o serve the sam e patron m ight view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. T h e A r c h f e y Your patron is a lord or lady o f the fey, a creature o f legend w h o holds secrets that w ere forgotten before the m ortal races w ere born. T h is b ein g ’s m otivations are often inscrutable, and som etim es w him sical, and m ight involve a striving for greater m agical p ow er or the settling o f age-old grudges.

W izards are suprem e m agic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. D raw ing on the subtle w eave o f m agic that perm eates the cosm os, w izards cast spells o f explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force m ind control. T heir m agic conjures m onsters from other p lanes o f existence, glim p ses the future, or turns slain foes into zom bies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call m eteors dow n from the sky, or open portals to other w orlds. S c h o l a r s o f t h e A r c a n e W ild and enigm atic, varied in form and function, the pow er o f m a gic draw s students w h o seek to m aster its m ysteries. S om e aspire to b e c o m e like the gods, shaping reality itself. T h ou gh the casting o f a typical spell requ ires m erely the utterance o f a few strange w ords, fleeting gestures, and som etim es a pinch or clum p o f exotic m aterials, th ese su rface com pon en ts barely hint at the expertise attained after years o f apprenticeship and cou n tless h ours o f study. W izards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secon dary. Th ey learn n ew sp ells as they experim ent and g row in experience. They can also learn them from other w izards, from ancient tom es or inscriptions, and from ancient creatu res (such as the fey) that are steeped in m agic. T h e L u r e o f K n o w l e d g e W iz a rd s’ lives are seld om m undane. T h e closest a w izard is likely to c om e to an ordinary life is w orkin g as a sage or lectu rer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets o f the multiverse. Other w izard s sell their serv ices as diviners, serve in m ilitary forces, or pursue lives o f crim e or dom ination. But the lure o f kn ow led ge and p ow er calls even the m ost unadventurous w iza rd s out o f the safety o f their libraries and laboratories and into cru m blin g ruins and lost cities.

C a n t r i p s At 1st level, you k n ow three cantrips o f your ch oice from the w izard spell list. You learn additional w izard cantrips o f your ch oice at higher levels, as sh ow n in the Cantrips K n ow n colum n o f the W izard table. Y o u r S p e l l b o o k The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature o f the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell o f 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form o f the spell, then deciphering the unique system o f notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level o f the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book— for example, if you want to make a backup copy o f your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level o f the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder o f your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation o f spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection o f notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap. S p e l l b o o k At 1st level, you have a sp ellb ook contain in g six 1st-level w izard spells o f your choice. P r e p a r i n g a n d C a s t i n g S p e l l s T h e W izard table sh ow s h ow m any spell slots you have to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast on e o f these spells, you m ust expend a slot o f the sp ell’s level or higher. You regain all expen ded spell slots w hen you finish a lon g rest. You prepare the list o f w izard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. c h o o s e a num ber o f w izard spells from your sp ellb ook equal to your Intelligence m odifier + your w izard level (m inim um o f on e spell). The spells must be o f a level for w hich you have spell slots. For exam ple, if you're a 3rd-level w izard, you have four 1st-level and tw o 2nd-level spell slots. W ith an Intelligence o f 16, your list o f prepared sp ells can include six spells o f 1st or 2nd level, in any com bination, ch osen from your sp ellbook . If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell d oesn ’t rem ove it from your list o f prepared spells. You can change your list o f prepared spells w hen you finish a long rest. P reparin g a n ew list o f w izard spells requires tim e spent studying your sp ellb ook and m em orizin g the incantations and gestures you m ust m ake to cast the spell: at least 1 m inute per spell level for each spell on your list. S p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y Intelligence is your sp ellcastin g ability for your w izard spells, sin ce you learn your sp ells through dedicated study and m em orization. You use your Intelligence w hen ever a spell refers to your sp ellcastin g ability. In addition, you u se your Intelligence m odifier w hen setting the saving th row D C for a w izard spell you cast and w hen m akin g an attack roll w ith one. Spell save D C = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier R i t u a l C a s t i n g You ca n cast a w izard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your sp ellbook . You don't n eed to have the sp ell prepared. S p e l l c a s t i n g F o c u s You can use an arcane focu s (found in chapter 5) as a spellcastin g focu s for your w izard spells. L e a r n i n g S p e l l s o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H i g h e r E ach tim e you gain a w izard level, you can add tw o w izard spells o f your ch oice to your sp ellbook . Each o f these spells must b e o f a level for w hich you have spell slots, as sh ow n on the W izard table. O n your adventures, you m ight find other spells that you can add to your sp ellb ook (see the “Your S p e llb o o k ” sidebar). A r c a n e R e c o v e r y You have learn ed to regain som e o f your m agical energy by studying your sp ellbook . O n ce p er day w hen you finish a short rest, you ca n c h o o s e expen ded spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a com b in ed level that is equal to or less than h alf your w izard level (rounded up), and n one o f the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to tw o levels w orth o f spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or tw o 1st-level spell slots. A r c a n e T r a d i t i o n W h en you reach 2nd level, you c h o o s e an arcane tradition, shaping your practice o f m agic through one o f eight sch ools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantm ent, Evocation, Illusion, N ecrom ancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end o f the class description. Your ch oice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t W h en you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can in crease on e ability sc o r e o f your ch oice by 2, or you ca n in crease tw o ability s c o r e s o f your ch oice by 1. A s norm al, you ca n ’t in crease an ability sco re above 20 using this feature. S p e l l M a s t e r y At 18th level, you have achieved such m astery over certain sp ells that you can cast them at w ill. C h oose a 1st-level w izard spell and a 2nd-level w izard spell that are in your sp ellbook . You can cast th ose spells at their low est level without expending a spell slot w hen you have them prepared. If you w ant to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as norm al. By spen din g 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both o f the spells you c h ose for different spells o f the sa m e levels. S i g n a t u r e S p e l l s W h en you reach 20th level, you gain m astery over tw o pow erful spells and can cast them with little effort. C h oose tw o 3rd-level w izard spells in your sp ellbook as your signature spells. You always have th ese spells prepared, they don ’t count against the num ber o f spells you have prepared, and you can cast each o f them on ce at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. W h en you do so, you can ’t do s o again until you finish a short or long rest. If you w ant to cast either spell at a higher level, you m ust expend a spell slot as norm al. A r c a n e T r a d i t i o n s T h e study o f w izardry is ancient, stretching ba ck to the earliest m ortal discov eries o f m agic. It is firmly established in the w orlds o f D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its com p lex study. Th e m ost co m m o n arcan e traditions in the m ultiverse revolve around the sch o o ls o f m agic. W izard s through the ages have cataloged thousands o f spells, grouping them into eight categories called sch ools, as d escrib ed in chapter 10. In som e places, these traditions are literally sch ools; a w izard m ight study at the S c h o o l o f Illusion w hile another studies a cross tow n at the S ch o o l o f Enchantm ent. In other institutions, the sch ools are m ore like acad em ic departm ents, w ith rival faculties com petin g for students and funding. Even w iza rd s w ho train apprentices in the solitude o f their ow n tow ers use the division o f m agic into sch o o ls as a learning device, sin ce the spells o f each sch o o l require m astery o f different techniques. S c h o o l o f A b j u r a t i o n T h e S c h o o l o f Abjuration em p h a sizes m agic that block s, banishes, or protects. D etractors o f this sc h o o l say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harm ful effects, protecting the w eak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a p h ilosoph ica l void. It is a proud and resp ected vocation. C alled abjurers, m em bers o f this sch o o l are sought w hen baleful spirits require exorcism , w hen im portant location s m ust be guarded against m agical spying, and w hen portals to other planes o f existence must be closed. A b j u r a t i o n S a v a n t B egin ning w hen you select this sch ool at 2nd level, the gold and tim e you m ust spend to cop y an abjuration spell into your sp ellb ook is halved. A r c a n e W a r d Starting at 2nd level, you can w eave m agic around you rself for protection. W h en you cast an abjuration spell o f 1st level or higher, you can sim ultaneously use a strand o f the spell’s m agic to create a m agical w ard on you rself that lasts until you finish a long rest. T h e w ard has hit points equal to tw ice your w izard level + your Intelligence modifier. W h enever you take dam age, the w ard takes the dam age instead. If this dam age reduces the w ard to 0 hit points, you take any rem aining dam age. W h ile the w ard has 0 hit points, it ca n ’t absorb dam age, but its m agic rem ains. W h enever you cast an abjuration spell o f 1st level or higher, the w ard regains a num ber o f hit points equal to tw ice the level o f the spell. O n ce you create the w ard, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest. P r o j e c t e d W a r d Starting at 6th level, w h en a creature that you can see w ithin 30 feet o f you takes dam age, you can u se your reaction to cau se your A rca n e W ard to absorb that dam age. If this dam age red u ces the w ard to 0 hit points, the w arded creature takes any rem aining dam age.

S p e l l R e s i s t a n c e Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving th row s against spells. Furtherm ore, you have resistan ce against the dam age o f spells. S c h o o l o f C o n j u r a t i o n A s a conjurer, you favor spells that p rod u ce objects and creatures out o f thin air. You can conjure billow ing clou d s o f killing fog or su m m on creatures from elsew h ere to fight on your behalf. A s your m astery grow s, you learn sp ells o f transportation and can teleport y ou rself a cross vast distances, even to other planes o f existence, in an instant.

This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and w eigh no m ore than 10 pou nds, and its form m ust be that o f a nonm agical object that you have seen. The object is visibly m agical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The ob ject disappears after 1 hour, w hen you use this feature again, or if it takes any dam age. B e n i g n T r a n s p o s i t i o n Starting at 6th level, you can u se your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an u n occu p ied sp ace that you can see.

D u r a b l e S u m m o n s Starting at 14th level, any creature that you su m m on or create w ith a conjuration spell has 30 tem porary hit points. S c h o o l o f D i v i n a t i o n Th e cou n sel o f a diviner is sought by royalty and com m on ers alike, for all seek a clearer understanding o f the past, present, and future. A s a diviner, you strive to part the veils o f space, time, and co n scio u sn e ss so that you can see clearly.

W h en you finish a lon g rest, roll tw o d 2 0 s and record the num bers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability ch eck m ade by you or a creature that you can see with one o f th ese foretelling rolls. You must c h o o s e to do so b efore the roll, and you can replace a roll in this w ay only on ce per turn. Each foretelling roll can be u sed only on ce.

E x p e r t D i v i n a t i o n B egin ning at 6th level, casting divination sp ells co m e s s o easily to you that it expends only a fraction o f your sp ellcastin g efforts. W h en you cast a divination spell o f 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expen ded spell slot. The slot you regain must be o f a level low er than the spell you cast and ca n ’t be higher than 5th level.

H y p n o t i c G a z e Starting at 2nd level w hen you c h o o s e this sch ool, your soft w ord s and enchanting gaze can m agically enthrall another creature. A s an action, c h o o s e one creature that you can see w ithin 5 feet o f you. If the target can see or hear you, it must su cce e d on a W isd om saving throw against your w izard spell save D C or b e charm ed by you until the end o f your next turn. The charm ed creature’s sp eed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can u se your action to m aintain this effect, extending its duration until the end o f your next turn. However, the effect ends if you m ove m ore than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see n or hear you, or if the creature takes dam age. O nce the effect ends, or if the creature su cceed s on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can ’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest. I n s t i n c t i v e C h a r m B egin ning at 6th level, w hen a creature you can see w ithin 30 feet o f you m akes an attack roll against you, you can u se your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is w ithin the attack’s range. T h e attacker m ust m ake a W isd om saving throw against your w izard spell save DC. O n a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker c h o o s e s w h ich one to target. On a su ccessfu l save, you ca n ’t u se this feature on the attacker again until you finish a lon g rest. You m ust c h o o s e to u se this feature before kn ow in g w hether the attack hits or m isses. Creatures that can ’t be charm ed are im m u ne to this effect. S p l i t E n c h a n t m e n t Starting at 10th level, w hen you cast an enchantm ent spell o f 1st level or higher that targets only on e creature, you can have it target a se co n d creature. A l t e r M e m o r i e s At 14th level, you gain the ability to m ake a creature unaw are o f your m agical influence on it. W h en you cast an enchantm ent spell to charm one or m ore creatures, you can alter on e creatu re’s understanding s o that it rem ains unaw are o f being charm ed. Additionally, on ce before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to m ake the ch osen creature forget som e o f the tim e it spent charm ed. The creature must su cceed on an Intelligence saving th row against your w izard spell save D C or lose a num ber o f hours o f its m em ories equal to 1 + your C harism a m odifier (m inim um 1). You can m ake the creature forget less time, and the am ount o f tim e can ’t ex ceed the duration o f your enchantm ent spell. S c h o o l o f E v o c a t i o n You focu s your study on m agic that creates pow erfu l elem ental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. S om e evokers find em ploym ent in m ilitary forces, serving as artillery to blast enem y arm ies from afar. O thers use their spectacular pow er to protect the w eak, w hile som e seek their ow n gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. E v o c a t i o n S a v a n t B egin ning w hen you select this sch o o l at 2nd level, the gold and tim e you m ust sp end to cop y an evocation spell into your sp ellb ook is halved. S c u l p t S p e l l s B egin ning at 2nd level, you can create pock ets o f relative safety w ithin the effects o f your evocation spells. W h en you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can c h o o s e a num ber o f them equal to 1 + the sp ell’s level. T h e ch osen creatu res autom atically s u cce e d on their saving throw s against the spell, and they take no dam age if they w ould n orm ally take h alf dam age on a su ccessfu l save. P o t e n t C a n t r i p Starting at 6th level, your dam aging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt o f the effect. W h en a creature su cce e d s on a saving th row against your cantrip, the creature takes h alf the cantrip’s dam age (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. E m p o w e r e d E v o c a t i o n B egin ning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence m odifier to the dam age roll o f any w izard evocation spell you cast. O v e r c h a n n e l Starting at 14th level, you can in crease the pow er o f your sim pler spells. W h en you cast a w izard spell o f 5th level or low er that deals dam age, you can deal m axim u m dam age w ith that spell. The first tim e you do so, you suffer n o adverse effect. If you u se this feature again b efore you finish a long rest, you take 2 d 12 n ecrotic dam age for each level o f the spell, im m ediately after you cast it. E ach tim e you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the n ecrotic dam age per spell level in creases by 1d 12. This dam age ig n ores resistan ce and immunity. S c h o o l o f I l l u s i o n You focu s your studies on m agic that dazzles the sen ses, befu ddles the mind, and tricks even the w isest folk. Your m agic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen m ind m ake the im possible seem real. S om e illusionists—including m any gnom e w iza rd s—are benign tricksters w h o use their spells to entertain. O thers are m ore sinister m asters o f deception , using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their person al gain. I l l u s i o n S a v a n t B egin ning w hen you select this sch o o l at 2nd level, the gold and tim e you m ust spend to cop y an illusion spell into your sp ellb ook is halved. I m p r o v e d M i n o r I l l u s i o n W h en you c h o o s e this sch ool at 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already k n ow this cantrip, you learn a different w izard cantrip o f your ch oice. T h e cantrip d oesn ’t coun t against your n um ber o f cantrips know n. W h en you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sou n d and an im age with a single casting o f the spell. M a l l e a b l e I l l u s i o n s Starting at 6th level, w hen you cast an illusion spell that has a duration o f 1 m inute or longer, you can u se your action to change the nature o f that illusion (using the sp ell’s n orm al param eters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion. I l l u s o r y S e l f B egin ning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate o f y ou rself as an instant, alm ost instinctual reaction to danger. W h en a creature m akes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to in terpose the illusory duplicate b etw een the attacker and yourself. T h e attack autom atically m isses you, then the illusion dissipates. O nce you u se this feature, you ca n ’t u se it again until you finish a sh ort or lon g rest. I l l u s o r y R e a l i t y By 14th level, you have learned the secret o f w eaving sh ad ow m agic into your illusions to give them a sem i- reality. W h en you cast an illusion spell o f 1st level or higher, you can c h o o s e one inanim ate, n onm agical object that is part o f the illusion and m ake that object real. You ca n do this on your turn as a bon u s action w hile the spell is on goin g. T h e object rem ains real for 1 minute. For exam ple, you can create an illusion o f a bridge over a chasm and then m ake it real long en ough for your allies to cross. The object ca n ’t deal dam age or oth erw ise directly harm anyone. S c h o o l o f N e c r o m a n c y The S ch o o l o f N ecrom an cy explores the co sm ic forces o f life, death, and undeath. A s you focu s your studies in this tradition, you learn to m anipulate the energy that anim ates all living things. A s you p rogress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your m agic destroys its body, transform ing that vital en ergy into m agical p ow er you can m anipulate. M ost p eop le see n ecrom a n cers as m enacing, or even villainous, due to the clo s e a ssocia tion w ith death. Not all n ecrom a n cers are evil, but the forces they m anipulate are con sid ered ta boo by m any societies. N e c r o m a n c y S a v a n t B egin ning w hen you select this sch o o l at 2nd level, the gold and tim e you must sp en d to cop y a n ecrom a n cy spell into your sp ellb ook is halved.

O nce p er turn w hen you kill on e or m ore creatu res w ith a spell o f 1st level or higher, you regain hit poin ts equal to tw ice the sp ell’s level, or three tim es its level if the spell b elon gs to the S ch o o l o f N ecrom ancy. You d on ’t gain this benefit for killing con stru cts or undead. U n d e a d T h r a l l s At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your sp ellb ook if it is not there already. W h en you cast animate dead, you can target one additional c orp se or pile o f b on es, creating another zom bie or skeleton, as appropriate. W h en ever you create an undead using a n ecrom an cy spell, it has additional benefits: • T h e creatu re’s hit point m axim u m is in creased by an am ount equal to your w izard level. • T h e creature adds your proficiency bon u s to its w eap on dam age rolls. I n u r e d t o U n d e a t h B egin n in g at 10th level, you have resistan ce to n ecrotic dam age, and your hit point m axim u m can't be reduced. You have spent s o m uch tim e dealing w ith undead and the forces that anim ate them that you have b e c o m e inured to so m e o f their w orst effects. C o m m a n d U n d e a d Starting at 14th level, you can use m a gic to bring undead under your control, even th ose created by other w izards. A s an action, you can c h o o s e one undead that you ca n see w ithin 60 feet o f you. That creature must m ake a C harism a saving th row against your w izard spell save DC. If it su cceed s, you ca n ’t u se this feature on it again. If it fails, it b e c o m e s friendly to you and ob ey s your com m a n d s until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to con trol in this way. If the target has an Intelligence o f 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving th row and h as an Intelligence o f 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving th row at the end o f every h our until it s u c ce e d s and break s free. S c h o o l o f T r a n s m u t a t i o n You are a student o f spells that m odify energy and matter. To you, the w orld is not a fixed thing, but em inently mutable, and you delight in being an agent o f change. You w ield the raw stuff o f creation and learn to alter both physical form s and mental qualities. Your m agic gives you the tools to b e co m e a smith on reality’s forge. S o m e transm uters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning p eople into toads and transform ing cop p er into silver for fun and o cca sion a l profit. O thers pu rsue their m agical studies w ith deadly seriou sn ess, seek in g the p ow er o f the g od s to m ake and destroy w orlds. T r a n s m u t a t i o n S a v a n t B egin ning w hen you select this sc h o o l at 2nd level, the gold and tim e you must spend to cop y a transm utation spell into your sp ellb ook is halved. M i n o r A l c h e m y Starting at 2nd level w hen you select this sch ool, you can tem porarily alter the physical properties o f one n onm agical object, changin g it from on e su bstance into another. You perform a sp ecia l alch em ical p rocedu re on on e object co m p o s e d entirely o f w ood , stone (but not a gem stone), iron, copper, or silver, transform ing it into a different on e o f th ose m aterials. F or each 10 m inutes you sp end perform in g the procedu re, you can transform up to 1 cu b ic foot o f material. A fter 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you w ere concentratin g on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance. T r a n s m u t e r ’ s S t o n e Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transm uter’s stone that stores transm utation m agic. You can benefit from the stone y ou rself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit o f your ch oice as lon g as the stone is in the creatu re’s p ossession . W h en you create the stone, c h o o s e the benefit from the follow in g options: • D arkvision out to a range o f 60 feet, as d escrib ed in chapter 8 • A n in crease to sp eed o f 10 feet w hile the creature is u n en cu m bered • P roficien cy in Constitution saving throw s • R esistan ce to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder dam age (your ch oice w henever you c h o o s e this benefit) E ach tim e you cast a transm utation spell o f 1st level or higher, you can change the effect o f your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a n ew transm uter’s stone, the previous on e c e a se s to function. S h a p e c h a n g e r At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your sp ellbook , if it is not there already. You can cast polymorph w ithout expending a spell slot. W h en you do so, you can target only y ou rself and transform into a beast w h o s e challenge rating is 1 or lower. O nce you cast polymorph in this way, you ca n ’t do so again until you finish a short or lon g rest, though you can still cast it n orm ally using an available spell slot. M a s t e r T r a n s m u t e r Starting at 14th level, you can u se your action to con su m e the reserve o f transm utation m agic stored w ithin your transm uter’s stone in a single burst. W h en you do so, c h o o s e one o f the follow in g effects. Your transm uter’s stone is destroyed and ca n ’t be rem ade until you finish a lon g rest. Major Transformation. You can transm ute one n on m agica l ob ject—no larger than a 5-foot cu b e —into another nonm agical object o f sim ilar size and m a ss and o f equal or lesser value. You m ust spend 10 minutes h andling the ob ject to transform it. Panacea. You rem ove all curses, diseases, and p oisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transm uter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points. Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transm uter’s stone, w ithout expending a spell slot or n eedin g to have the spell in your spellbook. Restore Youth. You touch the transm uter’s stone to a w illing creature, and that creatu re’s apparent age is red u ced by 3 d 10 years, to a m inim um o f 13 years. This effect d oesn ’t extend the creatu re’s lifespan. C h a p t e r 4 : P e r s o n a l i t y a n d B a c k g r o u n d CHARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN their race and class. T h ey’re individuals with their ow n stories, interests, con n ection s, and capabilities beyond th ose that cla ss and race define. T h is chapter ex pou n ds on the details that distinguish characters from on e another, including the b a sics o f nam e and physical description, the rules o f b a ck grou n ds and languages, and the finer points o f personality and alignm ent. C h a r a c t e r D e t a i l s Your character’s nam e and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s w orth thinking about h ow these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. N a m e Your character’s race description in cludes sam ple nam es for m em bers o f that race. Put som e thought into your nam e even if y ou ’re ju st pickin g on e from a list. S e x You can play a m ale or fem ale character w ithout gaining any sp ecial benefits or h indrances. T h in k about how your character d o e s or d o e s not con form to the broader culture’s expectations o f sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For exam ple, a m ale d row cleric defies the traditional gender divisions o f d row society, w hich could b e a reason for your character to leave that society and co m e to the surface. T i k a a n d A r t e m i s : C o n t r a s t i n g C h a r a c t e r s The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters. Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s trade on the streets o f Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor o f the Inn o f the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town o f Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one o f her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career. Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one o f the city's hundreds o f poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice o f one o f the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks o f the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills. Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends. You d on ’t need to be con fin ed to binary n otion s of sex and gender. The elf g od C orellon Larethian is often seen as an drogyn ous or herm aphroditic, for exam ple, and som e elves in the m ultiverse are m ade in C orellon ’s im age. You cou ld also play a fem ale character w ho presen ts h erself as a man, a m an w h o feels trapped in a fem ale body, or a bearded fem ale dw arf w h o hates being m istaken for a male. L ikew ise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide. H e i g h t a n d W e i g h t You can d ecide your character’s height and weight, using the inform ation provided in your race description or on the R an d om Height and W eight table. T h in k about w hat your character’s ability s c o r e s m ight say about his or her height and weight. A w ea k but agile character m ight b e thin. A strong and tough character m ight be tall or ju st heavy. If you w ant to, you can roll random ly for your character’s height and w eight u sin g the R a n d om Height and W eight table. The d ice roll given in the Height M odifier colum n determ ines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyon d the ba se height. That sam e n um ber m ultiplied by the d ice roll or quantity given in the W eight M odifier colu m n determ ines the character’s extra w eight (in pounds) beyond the base weight. R a n d o m H e i g h t a n d W e i g h t Base Height Base Weight Race Height Modifier Weight Modifier Human 4'8" + 2 d 10 110 lb. x (2d4) lb. Dwarf, hill 3'8” +2d4 115 lb. x (2d6) lb.

Tiefling 4 '9 " +2d8 110 lb. x (2d4) lb. For exam ple, as a hum an, Tika has a height o f 4 feet 8 in ch es plus 2 d 10 inches. H er player rolls 2 d 10 and gets a total o f 12, s o Tika stands 5 feet 8 in ch es tall. Then the player u ses that sam e roll o f 12 and m ultiplies it by 2d4 pou nds. H er 2d4 roll is 3, s o Tika w eigh s an extra 36 pou nd s ( 1 2 x 3) on top o f her base 110 pou nds, for a total o f 146 pounds. O t h e r P h y s i c a l C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s You c h o o s e your character’s age and the color o f his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch o f distinctiveness, you m ight w ant to give your character an unusual or m em orable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo. T i k a a n d A r t e m i s : C h a r a c t e r D e t a i l s Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an exotic land and carries a more mysterious name. Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need o f a shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless— betraying the emptiness of his life and soul. A l i g n m e n t A typical creature in the w orld s o f D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s has an alignm ent, w hich broadly d escrib es its m oral and person al attitudes. A lignm ent is a com bination o f tw o factors: on e identifies m orality (g ood , evil, or neutral), and the other d escrib es attitudes tow ard society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignm ents define the p ossib le com bination s. T h ese brief su m m aries o f the nine alignm ents d escrib e the typical behavior o f a creature with that alignm ent. Individuals m ight vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few p eop le are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts o f their alignment. Lawful good (LG ) creatu res can be cou n ted on to do the right thing as ex pected by society. G old dragons, paladins, and m ost dw arves are lawful good. Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others a ccord in g to their needs. M any celestials, som e clou d giants, and m ost g n om es are neutral good. Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their co n s cie n ce directs, with little regard for w hat others expect. C opp er dragons, m any elves, and u n icorn s are chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN ) individuals act in a ccord a n ce w ith law, tradition, or p erson al cod es. M any m on k s and som e w iza rd s are law ful neutral. Neutral (N ) is the alignm ent o f th ose w h o prefer to steer clear o f m oral questions and d on ’t take sides, D w a r v i s h S c r i p t : S a m p l e A l p h a b e t doin g w hat seem s best at the tim e. Lizardfolk, m ost druids, and m any h um ans are neutral. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatu res follow their w him s, h olding their p erson al freed om above all else. M any barbarians and rogu es, and som e bards, are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures m ethodically take what they want, within the limits o f a cod e o f tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. Neutral evil (N E ) is the alignm ent o f th ose w ho do w hatever they can get away with, without com p a ssion or qualm s. M any drow, som e cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatu res act w ith arbitrary violen ce, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. D em on s, red dragons, and orc s are chaotic evil. A l i g n m e n t i n t h e M u l t i v e r s e For m any thinking creatures, alignm ent is a m oral choice. H um ans, dw arves, elves, and other hum anoid races can c h o o s e w hether to follow the paths o f g o o d or evil, law or chaos. A ccord in g to myth, the good-align ed g od s w h o created th ese races gave them free w ill to c h o o s e their m oral paths, k n ow in g that g o o d without free w ill is slavery. The evil deities w h o created other races, though, m ade th ose races to serve them . T h ose races have strong in born ten den cies that match the nature o f their gods. M ost o r c s share the violent, savage nature o f the orc god, G ruum sh, and are thus inclined tow ard evil. Even if an orc c h o o s e s a g o o d alignm ent, it stru ggles against its innate ten den cies for its entire life. (Even h alf-orcs feel the lingering pull o f the orc g o d ’s influence.) A lignm ent is an essential part o f the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil d o e s not c h o o s e to be lawful evil, and it d oesn ’t tend tow ard lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essen ce. If it som eh ow cea sed to b e law ful evil, it w ou ld ce a se to be a devil. M ost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignm ents—they are unaligned. S u ch a creature is incapable o f m akin g a m oral or ethical ch oice and acts accord in g to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for exam ple, but they are not evil; they have n o alignm ent. L a n g u a g e s Your race indicates the languages your character can sp eak by default, and your backgrou n d m ight give you a c c e s s to on e or m ore additional languages o f your ch oice. Note th ese languages on your character sheet. C h o o se your languages from the Standard Languages table, or c h o o s e on e that is com m on in your cam paign. W ith your D M ’s perm ission , you can instead c h o o s e a language from the E xotic L an guages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue o f druids. S o m e o f these languages are actually fam ilies o f languages w ith m any dialects. For exam ple, the P rim ordial language in cludes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, on e for each o f the four elem ental planes. Creatures that sp eak different dialects o f the sa m e language can com m u n ica te w ith on e another.

Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value o f sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder. As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must— and when it’s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters. P e r s o n a l C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s F lesh in g out your character’s personality—the array o f traits, m annerism s, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a p erson a unique identity—w ill help you brin g him or her to life as you play the gam e. Four categories o f characteristics are presented here: person ality traits, ideals, bon ds, and flaws. B eyond th ose categories, think about your character’s favorite w ord s or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, v ices and pet peeves, and w hatever else you can im agine. E ach backgrou n d presen ted later in this chapter includes su ggested characteristics that you ca n use to spark your im agination. Y ou’re not bou n d to th ose options, but they’re a g o o d starting point. P e r s o n a l i t y T r a i t s G ive your character tw o personality traits. Personality traits are sm all, sim ple w ays to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you som eth in g interesting and fun about your character. They should b e self- d escriptions that are sp ecific about w hat m akes your character stand out. “I’m sm art” is not a g o o d trait, b eca u se it d escrib es a lot o f characters. “I’ve read every b o o k in C andlekeep” tells you som eth in g sp ecific about your character’s interests and disposition. Person ality traits m ight d escrib e the things your character likes, his or her past accom plish m en ts, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self- attitude or m ann erism s, or the influence o f his or her ability scores. E l v i s h S c r i p t : S a m p l e A l p h a b e t T i k a a n d A r t e m i s : P e r s o n a l C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, precise confidence. Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value o f life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals o f life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals o f impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn o f the Last Home. The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as “ I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction o f the Inn o f the Last Home.” Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do’ Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something o f himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, he might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin— he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as “ I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do’ Urden.” Each o f these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think o f her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relationship and just wants to be left alone. A u seful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and low est ability s co re s and define one trait related to each. Either on e cou ld be positive or negative: you might w ork hard to overcom e a low score, for exam ple, or be cock y about your high score. D r a c o n i c S c r i p t : S a m p l e A l p h a b e t I d e a l s D escribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the fundam ental m oral and ethical principles that com p el you to act as you do. Ideals en com p a ss everything from your life goals to your c o re b elief system . Ideals might an sw er any o f these questions: W hat are the principles that you w ill never betray? W hat w ould prom pt you to m ake sa crifices? W hat drives you to act and guides your goals and am bitions? W h at is the single m ost im portant thing you strive for? You can c h o o s e any ideals you like, but your character’s alignm ent is a g o o d place to start defining them. E ach backgrou n d in this chapter includes six su ggested ideals. Five o f them are linked to asp ects o f alignm ent: law, chaos, g ood, evil, and neutrality. The last one has m ore to do with the particular backgrou n d than with m oral or ethical perspectives. B o n d s Create one bon d for your character. B on d s represent a character’s con n ection s to people, places, and events in the w orld. They tie you to things from your background. They m ight inspire you to heights o f heroism , or lead you to act against your ow n best interests if they are threatened. They can w ork very m uch like ideals, driving a character’s m otivations and goals. B on ds m ight answ er any o f these questions: W h om do you care m ost about? To w hat place do you feel a special con n ection ? W hat is your m ost treasured p os se ss io n ? Your b on d s might b e tied to your class, your backgrou n d, your race, or som e other aspect o f your character’s history or personality. You m ight also gain n ew b on d s over the cou rse o f your adventures. F l a w s Finally, c h o o s e a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents som e vice, com pu lsion, fear, or w ea k n ess—in particular, anything that som eon e else co u ld exploit to bring you to ruin or cau se you to act against your best interests. M ore significant than negative personality traits, a flaw m ight answ er any o f these questions: W hat en rages you? W h a t’s the one person , con cept, or event that you are terrified o f? W hat are your vices? I n s p i r a t i o n Inspiration is a rule the D u n geon M aster can use to rew ard you for playing your character in a w ay that’s true to his or her person ality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By u sing inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait o f com p a ssion for the dow ntrodden to give you an edge in negotiating w ith the B egga r P rince. Or inspiration ca n let you call on your bon d to the defen se o f your h om e village to push past the effect o f a spell that has been laid on you. G a i n i n g I n s p i r a t i o n Your D M can c h o o s e to give you inspiration for a variety o f reason s. Typically, D M s award it w hen you play out your personality traits, give in to the draw backs presen ted by a flaw or bond, and oth erw ise portray your character in a com p ellin g way. Your DM w ill tell you h ow you can earn inspiration in the game. You either have inspiration or you don ’t—you ca n ’t stockpile m ultiple “inspirations” for later use. U s i n g I n s p i r a t i o n If you have inspiration, you can expend it w hen you m ake an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can rew ard another player for g o o d roleplaying, clever thinking, or sim ply d oin g som eth in g exciting in the game. W h en another player character d o e s som eth in g that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you ca n give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration. B a c k g r o u n d s Every story has a beginning. Your character’s ba ckgrou n d reveals w h ere you ca m e from , h ow you be ca m e an adventurer, and your place in the w orld. Your fighter m ight have been a cou ra g eou s knight or a grizzled soldier. Your w izard cou ld have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogu e m ight have gotten by as a guild th ief or com m a n d ed au dien ces as a jester. C h oosin g a ba ck grou n d provides you w ith im portant story c u e s about your character’s identity. T h e m ost im portant question to ask about your back grou n d is what changed? W h y did you stop doin g w hatever your backgrou n d d escrib es and start adventuring? W h ere did you get the m on ey to pu rch ase your starting gear, or, if you c om e from a w ealthy background, w hy don't you have more m oney? H ow did you learn the skills o f your class? W hat sets you apart from ordinary p eop le w ho share your backgrou n d? T i k a a n d A r t e m i s : B a c k g r o u n d s Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid didn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools of thievery and poison. T h e sam ple ba ck grou n ds in this chapter provide both con crete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying su ggestions. P r o f i c i e n c i e s Each backgrou n d gives a character p roficiency in tw o skills. Skills are d escrib ed in chapter 7. In addition, m ost ba ck grou n ds give a character proficiency w ith one or m ore tools. T ools and tool proficien cies are detailed in chapter 5. If a character w ould gain the sam e proficiency from tw o different sou rces, he or she can c h o o s e a different proficiency o f the sam e kind (skill or tool) instead. L a n g u a g e s S o m e back grou n ds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyon d th ose given by race. S e e “L an gu a ges” earlier in this chapter. E q u i p m e n t Each back grou n d provides a pack age o f starting equipm ent. If you u se the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipm ent from your background. S u g g e s t e d C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s A b ack grou n d contains su ggested person al characteristics ba sed on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll d ice to determ ine them randomly, or u se the su ggestion s as inspiration for characteristics of your ow n creation. C u s t o m i z i n g a B a c k g r o u n d You might w ant to tw eak som e o f the features o f a ba ckgrou n d s o it better fits your character or the cam paign setting. To cu stom ize a backgrou n d, you can replace on e feature w ith any other one, c h o o s e any tw o skills, and ch o o s e a total o f tw o tool proficien cies or languages from the sam ple backgrou n ds. You can either use the equipm ent package from your backgrou n d or spend co in on gear as describ ed in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you ca n ’t also take the equipm ent pack age suggested for your class.) Finally, c h o o s e tw o personality traits, on e ideal, on e bond, and on e flaw. If you ca n ’t find a feature that m atches you r desired backgrou n d, w ork with your DM to create one. A c o l y t e You have spent your life in the serv ice o f a tem ple to a sp ecific god or pantheon o f gods. You act as an interm ediary b etw een the realm o f the holy and the mortal w orld, perform in g sa cred rites and offering sa crifices in order to con du ct w orsh ipers into the presen ce o f the divine. You are not n ecessarily a c le r ic -p e r fo r m in g sa cred rites is not the sam e thing as channeling divine pow er. C h oose a god, a pantheon o f gods, or som e other quasi-divine bein g from a m on g th ose listed in appendix B or th ose sp ecified by your DM, and w ork w ith your DM to detail the nature o f your religious service. W ere you a lesser fu nction ary in a tem ple, raised from ch ild h ood to assist the priests in the sa cred rites? Or w ere you a high priest w h o suddenly experien ced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you w ere the leader o f a sm all cult outside o f any established tem ple structure, or even an occu lt group that served a fiendish m aster that you n ow deny. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, R eligion Languages: Two o f your ch oice Equipment: A holy sym bol (a gift to you w hen you entered the priesthood ), a prayer b o o k or prayer w heel, 5 sticks o f in cen se, vestm ents, a set o f com m on clothes, and a belt pou ch contain in g 15 gp F e a t u r e : S h e l t e r o f t h e Fa i t h f u l A s an acolyte, you com m a n d the respect o f th ose w ho share your faith, and you can perform the religious cerem on ies o f your deity. You and your adventuring com p a n ion s can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presen ce o f your faith, though you must provide any material com pon en ts n eed ed for spells. T h ose w h o share your religion w ill support you (but only you) at a m od est lifestyle. You m ight also have ties to a sp ecific tem ple dedicated to your ch osen deity or pantheon, and you have a residen ce there. This cou ld be the tem ple w here you u sed to serve, if you rem ain on g ood term s w ith it, or a tem ple w here you have found a n ew h om e. W h ile near your tem ple, you can call u pon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardou s and you rem ain in g o o d standing with your temple. S u g g e s t e d C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s A colytes are shaped by their experien ce in tem ples or other religious com m u n ities. Their study o f the history and tenets o f their faith and their relationships to tem ples, shrines, or hierarch ies affect their m ann erism s and ideals. Th eir flaws might b e som e hidden h ypocrisy o r heretical idea, or an ideal or bon d taken to an extrem e. d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero o f my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 3 I see omens in every event and action.

A s a m em ber o f your guild, you k n ow the skills n eeded to create finished item s from raw m aterials (reflected in your proficiency w ith a certain kind o f artisan’s tools), as w ell as the prin ciples o f trade and g o o d bu siness practices.

Your guild might b e a large m erchant con sortiu m (or family) with interests a cross the region. Perhaps you transported g o o d s from one place to another, by ship, w agon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your ow n little shop. In so m e w ays, the traveling m erchant’s life lends itself to adventure far m ore than the life o f an artisan. Rather than proficiency w ith artisan’s tools, you m ight b e proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional language.

Respect is due to me because o f my position, but all people regardless o f station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good) 2 Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority o f those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful) 3 Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling o f my family. (Chaotic) 4 Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil) 5 Family. Blood runs thicker than water. (Any) 6 Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good) d6 Bond 1 I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family. 2 My house’s alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs. 3 Nothing is more important than the other members o f my family. 4 I am in love with the heir o f a family that my family despises. 5 My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering. 6 The common folk must see me as a hero o f the people. d6 Flaw 1 I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me. 2 I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever. 3 I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I’m quick to anger. 4 I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures. 5 In fact, the world does revolve around me. 6 By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family. d8 Personality Trait 1 I’m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home. 2 I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups. 3 I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I’d do it again if I had to. 4 I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature. 5 I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won’t save you from a hungry owlbear. 6 I’m always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them. 7 I feel far more comfortable around animals than people. 8 I was, in fact, raised by wolves. d6 Ideal 1 Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic) 2 Greater Good. It is each person’s responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good) 3 Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful) 4 Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil) 5 Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs o f civilization. (Neutral) 6 Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any) d6 Bond 1 My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. 2 An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me. 3 I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland. 4 I am the last o f my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend. 5 I suffer awful visions o f a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it. 6 It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe. d6 Flaw 1 I am too enamored o f ale, wine, and other intoxicants. 2 There’s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest. 3 I remember every insult I’ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who’s ever wronged me. 4 I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies. 5 Violence is my answer to almost any challenge. 6 Don’t expect me to save those who can’t save themselves. It is nature’s way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. S a g e You spent y ears learning the lore o f the m ultiverse.

M em bers o f the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a m ine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, m easuring gold by the pou n d rather than by the coin. Only m erchants, adventurers, and th ose offering professional serv ices for hire com m on ly deal in coins. C o i n a g e C om m on coin s co m e in several different denom inations ba sed on the relative w orth o f the m etal from w h ich they are m ade. The three m ost com m on co in s are the gold p iece (gp), the silver p iece (sp), and the co p p e r p iece (cp). W ith on e gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet o f g o o d rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exception al) artisan can earn on e gold p iece a day. T h e gold p iece is the standard unit o f m easu re for w ealth, even if the coin itself is not com m on ly used. W h en m erchants d iscu ss deals that involve g o o d s or serv ices w orth hundreds or thousands o f gold p ieces, the transactions d on ’t usually involve the exch an ge o f individual coin s. Rather, the gold p iece is a standard m easu re o f value, and the actual exch an ge is in gold bars, letters o f credit, or valuable g ood s. O ne gold p iece is w orth ten silver p ieces, the m ost prevalent coin am ong com m on ers. A silver p iece buys a la borer’s w ork for a day, a flask o f lam p oil, or a night’s rest in a p o o r inn. O ne silver p iece is w orth ten cop p er p ieces, w h ich are com m on am ong laborers and beggars. A single cop p er p iece buys a candle, a torch, or a p iece o f chalk. In addition, unusual co in s m ade o f other preciou s m etals som etim es appear in treasure hoards. The electrum p iece (ep) and the platinum p iece (pp) originate from fallen em pires and lost kin gdom s, and they som etim es a rou se su spicion and skepticism w hen u sed in transactions.

Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets w hen you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and m erchants interested in your loot. Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. A s a general rule, u ndam aged w eapon s, armor, and other equipm ent fetch h alf their cost w hen sold in a market. W eapon s and arm or u sed by m on sters are rarely in g o o d enough condition to sell. Magic Items. S ellin g m a gic item s is problem atic. F inding som eon e to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out o f the realm o f m ost but the w ealthiest n obles. L ikew ise, aside from a few com m on m agic item s, you w o n ’t n orm ally co m e a cross m agic item s or spells to purchase. T h e value o f m agic is far beyond sim ple gold and should always be treated as such. Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. T h ese items retain their full value in the m arketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or u se them as cu rren cy for other transactions. For exception ally valuable treasures, the D M m ight require you to find a buyer in a large tow n or larger com m u n ity first. Trade Goods. O n the borderlands, m any p eople con du ct transactions through barter. Like gem s and art objects, trade g o o d s —bars o f iron, bags o f salt, livestock, and s o on —retain their full value in the m arket and can be u sed as currency. A r m o r a n d Sh i e l d s D & D w orld s are a vast tapestry m ade up o f m any different cultures, each w ith its ow n tech n ology level. F or this reason , adventurers have a c c e s s to a variety o f arm or types, ranging from leather arm or to chain m ail to costly plate armor, w ith several other kinds o f arm or in betw een . T h e A rm or table collects the m ost com m on ly available types o f arm or found in the gam e and separates them into three categories: light armor, m edium arm or, and heavy armor. M any w arriors supplem ent their arm or with a shield. V a r i a n t : E q u i p m e n t S i z e s In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds o f common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe. The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise. Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent o f the market price o f the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent o f the alterations required. T h e A rm or table sh ow s the cost, w eight, and other p roperties o f the com m on types o f arm or w orn in the w orld s o f D&D. Armor Proficiency.

Heavier arm or interferes w ith the w ea rer’s ability to m ove quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the A rm or table sh ow s “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength colum n for an arm or type, the arm or redu ces the w ea rer’s sp eed by 10 feet u nless the w earer has a Strength score equal to or h igher than the listed score. Stealth. If the A rm or table sh ow s “D isadvantage” in the Stealth colum n, the w earer has disadvantage on D exterity (Stealth) checks. Shields.

L i g h t A r m o r M ade from supple and thin m aterials, light arm or favors agile adventurers sin ce it offers som e protection w ithout sacrificin g m obility.

M e d i u m A r m o r M edium arm or offers m ore protection than light armor, but it also im pairs m ovem ent m ore. If you w ear m edium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a m axim um o f +2, to the ba se num ber from your arm or type to determ ine your A rm or Class. Hide. T his cru de arm or con sists o f thick furs and pelts.

W e a p o n s W e a p o n P r o f i c i e n c y Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency w ith certain w eap on s or categories o f w eapon s. T h e tw o categories are simple and martial. M ost p eop le can u se sim ple w ea p on s with proficiency. T h ese w eap on s include clubs, m a ces, and other w ea p on s often found in the hands o f com m on ers. M artial w eapon s, including sw ords, axes, and polearm s, require m ore sp ecia lized training to u se effectively. M ost w arriors use m artial w ea p on s b eca u se th ese w ea p on s put their fighting style and training to best use. P roficien cy w ith a w ea p on allow s you to add your proficiency bon u s to the attack roll for any attack you m ake w ith that w eapon . If you m ake an attack roll using a w ea p on w ith w h ich you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bon u s to the attack roll. W e a p o n P r o p e r t i e s M any w eapons have special properties related to their use, as show n in the W eapons table. Am m unition. You can u se a w eap on that has the am m unition property to m ake a ranged attack only if you have am m unition to fire from the w eapon . E ach tim e you attack w ith the w eapon , you expend on e piece o f am m unition. D raw ing the am m unition from a quiver, case, or other container is part o f the attack. At the end o f the battle, you can recov er h alf your expen ded am m unition by taking a m inute to sea rch the battlefield. Your cla ss grants proficiency in certain w eapon s, reflecting both the class's fo cu s and the tools you are m ost likely to use. W h eth er you favor a lon gsw ord or a longbow , your w ea p on and your ability to w ield it effectively can m ea n the difference betw een life and death w hile adventuring. Th e W ea pon s table sh ow s the m ost co m m o n w eap on s u sed in the w orld s o f D&D, their price and w eight, the dam age they deal w hen they hit, and any sp ecia l p roperties they p o s se ss . Every w eap on is classified as either m elee or ranged. A m elee weapon is u sed to attack a target w ithin 5 feet o f you, w h ereas a ranged weapon is u sed to attack a target at a distance. If you use a w eapon that has the ammunition property to m ake a m elee attack, you treat the w eapon as an im provised w eapon (see "Im provised W eapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any dam age w hen u sed in this way. Finesse. W h en m akin g an attack with a finesse w eapon , you use your ch oice o f your Strength or Dexterity m odifier for the attack and dam age rolls. You must use the sam e m odifier for both rolls. Heavy. S m all creatu res have disadvantage on attack rolls w ith heavy w eapon s. A heavy w ea p on ’s size and bulk m ake it too large for a S m all creature to use effectively. Light. A light w eap on is sm all and easy to handle, m aking it ideal for u se w hen fighting w ith tw o w eapon s. S e e the rules for tw o-w eapon fighting in chapter 9. Loading. B ecau se o f the time required to load this w eapon, you can fire only one piece o f am m unition from it w hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless o f the num ber o f attacks you can n orm ally make. Range. A w eap on that can b e u sed to m ake a ranged attack has a range sh ow n in paren th eses after the am m unition or throw n property. The range lists tw o n um bers. T h e first is the w ea p on ’s n orm al range in feet, and the se co n d indicates the w ea p on ’s m axim um range. W h en attacking a target beyon d n orm al range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You c a n ’t attack a target beyon d the w ea p on ’s long range. Reach. T his w ea p on adds 5 feet to your reach w hen you attack with it. Special. A w ea p on w ith the sp ecia l property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the w ea p on ’s description (see "S p ecia l W ea pon s" later in this section). Thrown. If a w eap on h as the th row n property, you can th row the w ea p on to m ake a ranged attack. If the w eap on is a m elee w eapon , you u se the sam e ability m odifier for that attack roll and dam age roll that you w ou ld u se for a m elee attack w ith the w eapon . For exam ple, if you th row a handaxe, you u se your Strength, but if you th row a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, sin ce the dagger has the fin esse property. Two-Handed. T h is w ea p on requ ires tw o hands to use. Versatile. T his w eap on can b e u sed w ith one or tw o hands. A d am age value in paren th eses appears w ith the property—the dam age w hen the w eap on is u sed with tw o hands to m ake a m elee attack. I m p r o v i s e d W e a p o n s S om etim es characters d on ’t have their w ea p on s and have to attack w ith w hatever is clo se at hand. An im provised w eap on includes any o b ject you can w ield in one or tw o hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a w agon w heel, or a dead goblin. In m any cases, an im provised w eap on is sim ilar to an actual w eap on and ca n be treated as such. For exam ple, a table leg is akin to a club. At the D M ’s option, a character proficient w ith a w eap on can use a sim ilar object as if it w ere that w eap on and u se his or her proficiency bonus. A n object that bea rs no resem b lan ce to a w eap on deals 1d4 dam age (the DM assigns a dam age type appropriate to the object). If a character u ses a ranged w eap on to m ake a m elee attack, or throw s a m elee w eap on that d o e s not have the throw n property, it also deals 1d4 dam age. A n im provised throw n w eap on has a norm al range o f 20 feet and a lon g range o f 60 feet. S i l v e r e d W e a p o n s S om e m on sters that have im m unity or resistan ce to n onm agical w ea p on s are su sceptible to silver w eapon s, s o cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their w ea p on s w ith silver. You can silver a single w eap on or ten p ieces o f am m unition for 100 gp. This co st represents not only the price o f the silver, but the tim e and expertise n eed ed to add silver to the w eapon w ithout m akin g it less effective. S p e c i a l W e a p o n s W ea p on s w ith sp ecia l rules are d escrib ed here. Lance. You have disadvantage w hen you u se a lance to attack a target w ithin 5 feet o f you. A lso, a lance requ ires tw o hands to w ield w hen you aren’t m ounted. Net. A Large or sm aller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatu res that are form less, or creatu res that are H uge or larger. A creature can u se its action to m ake a D C 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a su ccess. D ealing 5 slashing dam age to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without h arm in g it, ending the effect and destroying the net. W h en you u se an action, bon u s action, or reaction to attack w ith a net, you can m ake only on e attack regardless o f the num ber o f attacks you can norm ally make. A d v e n t u r i n g G e a r T h is section d escrib es item s that have sp ecia l rules or require further explanation. Acid. A s an action, you can splash the contents o f this vial onto a creature w ithin 5 feet o f you or th row the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on im pact. In either case, m ake a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an im provised w eapon . O n a hit, the target takes 2d 6 acid dam age. Alchem ist’s Fire. T h is sticky, adhesive fluid ignites w h en e x p osed to air. A s an action, you can th row this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on im pact.

Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear. Maintaining this kind o f lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent o f a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent o f a comfortable lifestyle. S e r v i c e s A dventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their beh alf in a variety o f circu m stan ces. M ost such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, w hile others are m asters o f a craft or art, and a few are experts with sp ecia lized adventuring skills. S o m e o f the m ost basic types o f hirelings appear on the S e rv ice s table. Other com m on hirelings include any o f the w id e variety o f p eople w h o inhabit a typical tow n or city, w hen the adventurers pay them to p erform a sp ecific task. For exam ple, a w izard might pay a carpenter to con stru ct an elaborate chest (and its m iniature replica) for u se in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A fighter m ight com m ission a blacksm ith to forge a sp ecia l sw ord. A bard might pay a tailor to m ake exquisite cloth in g for an u p com in g p erform a n ce in front o f the duke. O ther hirelings provide m ore expert or dangerou s serv ices. M ercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a h obgoblin arm y are hirelings, as are sa ges hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stron ghold o f som e kind, he or sh e m ight hire a w hole staff o f servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to m enial laborers to k eep the stables clean. T h ese h irelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live w ithin the stron ghold as part o f the offered com pen sation . S e r v i c e s Service Pay Coach cab Between towns 3 cp per mile Within a city 1 cp Hireling Skilled 2 gp per day Untrained 2 sp per day Messenger 2 cp per mile Road or gate toll 1 cp Ship’s passage 1 sp per mile Skilled hirelings include anyone h ired to perform a serv ice that involves a proficiency (including w eapon, tool, or skill): a m ercenary, artisan, scribe, and s o on. T h e pay sh ow n is a m inim um ; som e expert hirelings require m ore pay. U ntrained hirelings are hired for m enial w ork that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, m aids, and sim ilar w orkers. S p e l l c a s t i n g S e r v i c e s P eop le w h o are able to cast spells d on ’t fall into the category o f ordinary hirelings. It m ight be p ossib le to find som eon e w illin g to cast a spell in exch an ge for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. A s a rule, the higher the level o f the desired spell, the h arder it is to find som eon e w h o can cast it and the m ore it costs. H iring som eon e to cast a relatively co m m o n spell o f 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city o r town, and m ight cost 10 to 50 gold p ieces (plus the co st o f any expensive material com pon ents). Finding som eon e able and w illin g to cast a higher-level spell m ight involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one w ith a university or prom inent tem ple.

t e r 6: C u s t o m i z a t i o n O p t i o n s THE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE, class, and back grou n d defines your character’s capabilities in the gam e, and the person al details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even w ithin your class and race, you have options to fine-tune w hat your character can do. But this chapter is for players w h o —with the D M ’s p erm ission —w ant to go a step further. T h is chapter defines tw o optional sets o f rules for custom izin g your character: m ulticlassing and feats. M ulticlassing lets you com bin e cla sses together, and feats are sp ecia l options you can c h o o s e instead o f in creasin g your ability s c o r e s as you gain levels. Your D M d ecides w hether th ese options are available in a cam paign. M u l t i c l a s s i n g M ulticlassing allow s you to gain levels in multiple classes. D oin g s o lets you m ix the abilities o f th ose cla sses to realize a character con cep t that m ight not be reflected in on e o f the standard class options. W ith this rule, you have the option o f gaining a level in a n ew class w henever you advance in level, instead o f gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your cla sses are added together to determ ine your character level. F or exam ple, if you have three levels in w izard and tw o in fighter, you ’re a 5th-level character. A s you advance in levels, you m ight prim arily rem ain a m em ber o f your original class w ith ju st a few levels in another class, or you m ight change cou rse entirely, never look in g ba ck at the class you left behind. You m ight even start progressin g in a third or fourth class. C om pared to a sin gle-class character o f the sa m e level, you ’ll sa crifice so m e focu s in exchange for versatility. M u l t i c l a s s i n g E x a m p l e Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser. Gary decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st- level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1). When Gary’s character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/ wizard 1). P r e r e q u i s i t e s To qualify for a new class, you must m eet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as sh ow n in the M ulticlassing P rerequisites table. For exam ple, a barbarian w h o d ecid es to m ulticlass into the druid class must have both Strength and W isd om s c o r e s o f 13 or higher. W ithout the full training that a begin n in g character receives, you m ust b e a quick study in your n ew class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability s cores. M u l t i c l a s s i n g P r e r e q u i s i t e s Class Ability Score Mini m u m Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 E x p e r i e n c e P o i n t s The experien ce point co st to gain a level is always ba sed on your total character level, as sh ow n in the Character A dvancem ent table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. S o, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain en ough X P to reach 8th level b efore you can take your secon d level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. H i t P o i n t s a n d H i t D i c e Y ou gain the hit points from your new class as d escribed for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only w hen you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit D ice granted by all your cla sses to form your p o o l o f Hit D ice. If the Hit D ice are the sam e die type, you can sim ply p ool them together. For exam ple, both the fighter and the paladin have a d 10, s o if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10 Hit D ice. If your cla sses give you Hit D ice o f different types, keep track o f them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for exam ple, you have five d 10 Hit D ice and five d8 Hit D ice. P r o f i c i e n c y B o n u s Your p roficiency bon u s is always based on your total character level, as sh ow n in the Character Advancem ent table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. F or exam ple, if you are a fighter 3/rogu e 2, you have the p roficiency b on u s o f a 5th-level character, w hich is +3. P r o f i c i e n c i e s W h en you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only s o m e o f that cla ss’s starting proficiencies, as sh ow n in the M ulticlassing P roficien cies table. C l a s s F e a t u r e s W h en you gain a n ew level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules w hen you ’re m ulticlassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, U n arm ored D efense, and Spellcasting. C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again d oesn ’t give you an additional use o f it. You gain additional u ses only w hen you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For exam ple, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity tw ice betw een rests becau se you are high enough level in the cleric class to have m ore uses. W henever you use the feature, you can c h o o s e any o f the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your tw o classes. E x t r a A t t a c k If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from m ore than one class, the features don ’t add together. You ca n ’t m ake m ore than tw o attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version o f Extra Attack does). Similarly, the w a rlock ’s eldritch invocation T hirsting Blade d oesn ’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. U n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e If you already have the U narm ored D efen se feature, you c a n ’t gain it again from another class. S p e l l c a s t i n g Your capacity for sp ellcastin g depen ds partly on your com bin ed levels in all your sp ellcastin g cla sses and partly on your individual levels in th ose classes. O nce you have the S p ellcastin g feature from m ore than one class, u se the rules below . If you m ulticlass but have the S p ellcastin g feature from only on e class, you follow the rules as d escribed in that class. Spells Known and Prepared. You determ ine w hat sp ells you k n ow and can prepare for each class individually, as if you w ere a sin gle-classed m em ber of that class. If you are a ranger 4 /w iza rd 3, for exam ple, you kn ow three 1st-level ranger sp ells ba sed on your levels in the ranger class. A s 3rd-level w izard, you k n ow three w izard cantrips, and your sp ellb ook contain s ten w izard spells, tw o o f w h ich (the tw o you gained w hen you reached 3rd level as a w izard) can b e 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six w izard spells from your sp ellbook. Each spell you kn ow and prepare is associated with one o f your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability o f that class w hen you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy sym bol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus. Spell Slots. You determ ine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and w izard classes, h alf your levels (rounded dow n) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third o f your fighter or rogue levels (rounded dow n) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the A rca n e Trickster feature. U se this total to determ ine your spell slots by consultin g the M ulticlass S p ellcaster table. If you have m ore than on e sp ellcastin g class, this table might give you spell slots o f a level that is higher than the spells you k n ow o r can prepare. You can use th ose slots, but only to cast your low er-level spells. If a low er- level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an en h a n ced effect w hen cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the en hanced effect, even though you d on ’t have any spells o f that higher level. For exam ple, if you are the aforem entioned ranger 4 / w izard 3, you count as a 5th-level character w hen determ ining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and tw o 3rd-level slots. However, you don ’t k n ow any 3rd-level spells, nor do you kn ow any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots o f th ose levels to cast the spells you d o kn ow —and potentially en hance their effects. Pact Magic. If you have both the S p ellcastin g class feature and the Pact M agic class feature from the w arlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact M agic feature to cast spells you kn ow or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the S p ellcastin g class feature to cast w arlock sp ells you know.

F e a t s A feat represents a talent or an area o f expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It em bodies training, experience, and abilities beyond w hat a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability S c o r e Im provem ent feature. U sing the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat o f your ch oice instead. You can take each feat only on ce, u nless the feat’s description says otherw ise. You m ust m eet any prerequisite sp ecified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you ca n ’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For exam ple, the G rappler feat requ ires you to have a Strength o f 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced b elow 13 som eh ow —perhaps by a w ith ering cu rse — you ca n ’t benefit from the G rappler feat until your Stren gth is restored.

C h a p t e r 7: U s i n g A b i l i t y S c o r e s SIX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION o f every creatu re’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, m easu ring physical pow er • Dexterity, m easu ring agility • Constitution, m easu ring endurance • Intelligence, m easu ring reason in g and m em ory • W isdom , m easu ring perception and insight • Charisma, m easu ring force o f personality Is a character m u scle-b ou n d and insightful? Brilliant and charm ing? N im ble and hardy? Ability s co re s define th ese qualities—a creatu re’s assets as w ell as w ea k n esses. T h e three m ain rolls o f the gam e—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability sco re s. T h e b o o k ’s introduction d escrib es the ba sic rule beh in d these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability m odifier derived from on e o f the six ability sco re s, and com p a re the total to a target num ber. T h is chapter fo c u s e s on h ow to u se ability ch eck s and saving throw s, coverin g the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. R u les for attack rolls appear in chapter 9. A b i l i t y S c o r e s a n d M o d i f i e r s E ach o f a creatu re’s abilities has a score, a num ber that defines the m agnitude o f that ability. A n ability score is not just a m easu re o f innate capabilities, but also e n com p a sses a creatu re’s training and com p eten ce in activities related to that ability. A s c o r e o f 10 or 11 is the norm al hum an average, but adventurers and m any m on sters are a cut above average in m ost abilities. A s c o r e o f 18 is the highest that a p erson usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and m on sters and divine beings can have s c o r e s as high as 30. E ach ability also has a modifier, derived from the sc o r e and ranging from 5 (for an ability sc o r e o f 1) to +10 (for a sc o r e o f 30). T h e Ability S c o r e s and M odifiers table notes the ability m odifiers for the range o f p ossib le ability scores, from 1 to 30. A b i l i t y S c o r e s a n d M o d i f i e r s Score Modifier Score Modifier 1 -5 16-17 +3 2-3 -4 18-19 +4 4-5 -3 20-21 +5 6-7 -2 22-23 + 6 8-9 -1 24-25 +7 10-11 +0 26-27 +8 12-13 +1 28-29 +9 14-15 +2 30 +10 To determ ine an ability m odifier w ithout consultin g the table, subtract 10 from the ability sco re and then divide the total by 2 (round down). B eca u se ability m od ifiers affect alm ost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability m odifiers co m e up in play m ore often than their associa ted scores. A d v a n t a g e a n d D i s a d v a n t a g e S om etim es a sp ecia l ability o r spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. W h en that happens, you roll a se co n d d2 0 w hen you m ake the roll. U se the higher o f the tw o rolls if you have advantage, and use the low er roll if you have disadvantage. For exam ple, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you u se the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll th ose num bers, you u se the 17. If m ultiple situations affect a roll and each on e grants advantage or im p oses disadvantage on it, you d on ’t roll m ore than on e additional d20. If tw o favorable situations grant advantage, for exam ple, you still roll only one additional d20. If circu m sta n ces cau se a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are con sid ered to have neither o f them , and you roll one d20. T h is is true even if multiple circu m stan ces im p ose disadvantage and only on e grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. W h en you have advantage or disadvantage and som eth in g in the gam e, su ch as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one o f the dice. You c h o o s e w hich one. F or exam ple, if a halfling has advantage on an ability ch eck and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling cou ld u se the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the u se o f sp ecia l abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on ch eck s related to the character’s personality, ideals, or bon ds. T h e DM can also d ecide that circu m stan ces influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or im p ose disadvantage as a result. P r o f i c i e n c y B o n u s Characters have a proficiency bon u s determ ined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. M onsters also have this bonus, w hich is in corporated in their stat blocks. The bon u s is u sed in the rules on ability checks, saving throw s, and attack rolls. Your proficiency bonus c a n ’t be added to a single die roll or other num ber m ore than on ce. For exam ple, if tw o different rules say you can add your proficiency bon u s to a W isd om saving throw, you n evertheless add the bon u s only on ce w hen you m ake the save. O ccasionally, your proficiency bon u s m ight be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for exam ple) before you apply it. For exam ple, the rogu e's E xpertise feature dou bles the proficiency bon u s for certain ability ch ecks. If a circu m stan ce suggests that your proficiency bon u s applies m ore than on ce to the sa m e roll, you still add it only on ce and multiply or divide it only on ce. By the sam e token, if a feature or effect allow s you to multiply your proficiency bon u s w hen m akin g an ability ch eck that w ou ldn ’t norm ally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don ’t add the bon u s to the check. For that ch eck your proficiency bon u s is 0, given the fact that m ultiplying 0 by any n um ber is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the H istory skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bon u s w hen you m ake Intelligence (H istory) checks. In general, you d on ’t multiply your proficiency bon u s for attack rolls or saving throw s. If a feature or effect allow s you to do so, these sam e rules apply. A b i l i t y C h e c k s An ability ch eck tests a character’s or m on ster’s innate talent and training in an effort to ov ercom e a challenge. The DM calls for an ability ch eck w hen a character or m onster attem pts an action (other than an attack) that has a ch a n ce o f failure. W h en the ou tcom e is uncertain, the d ice determ ine the results. For every ability check, the DM decides w hich o f the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty o f the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The m ore difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty C lasses table sh ow s the m ost com m on D Cs. T y p i c a l D i f f i c u l t y C l a s s e s Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To m ake an ability check, roll a d2 0 and add the relevant ability modifier. A s w ith other d 2 0 rolls, apply bon u ses and penalties, and com pa re the total to the DC. If the total equals or e x ceed s the DC, the ability ch eck is a su c c e s s —the creature ov ercom es the challenge at hand. O therw ise, it’s a failure, w h ich m eans the character or m on ster m akes no p rogress tow ard the objective or m ak es p rogress com bin ed w ith a setback determ ined by the DM. C o n t e s t s _______________________________ S om etim es on e character’s or m on ster’s efforts are directly op p o s e d to another’s. T h is can o c cu r w hen both o f them are trying to do the sam e thing and only one can su cceed , such as attem pting to snatch up a m agic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies w hen on e o f them is trying to prevent the other one from accom p lish in g a goal—for exam ple, w hen a m onster tries to force open a d oor that an adventurer is h oldin g closed . In situations like these, the ou tcom e is determ ined by a sp ecia l form o f ability check, called a contest. B oth participants in a contest m ake ability ch eck s appropriate to their efforts. Th ey apply all appropriate b on u ses and penalties, but instead o f com p a rin g the total to a DC, they com pa re the totals o f their tw o checks. The participant with the higher ch eck total w in s the contest. That character or m onster either su cce e d s at the action or prevents the other on e from su cceedin g. If the contest results in a tie, the situation rem ains the sam e as it w as before the contest. Thus, on e contestant m ight w in the contest by default. If tw o characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest b etw een a m onster trying to open a d oor and an adventurer trying to keep the d oor closed, a tie m eans that the d oor rem ains shut. S k i l l s E ach ability covers a broad range o f capabilities, including skills that a character or a m onster can be proficient in. A skill represents a sp ecific aspect o f an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill dem onstrates a focu s on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficien cies are determ ined at character creation, and a m on ster’s skill proficiencies appear in the m on ster’s stat block.) F or exam ple, a Dexterity ch eck m ight reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each o f th ese a sp ects o f Dexterity has an a ssocia ted skill: A crobatics, Sleight o f Hand, and Stealth, respectively. S o a character w h o has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly g o o d at D exterity ch eck s related to sn eaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability sc o r e are sh ow n in the follow in g list. (N o skills are related to Constitution.) S e e an ability’s description in the later section s o f this chapter for exam ples o f h ow to u se a skill associated w ith an ability. S om etim es, the DM m ight ask for an ability ch eck using a sp ecific skill—for exam ple, “M ake a W isd om (P erception ) ch eck .” At other tim es, a player m ight ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill m eans an individual can add his or her proficiency bon u s to ability ch eck s that involve that skill. W ithout proficiency in the skill, the individual m akes a n orm al ability check. Strength A thletics Dexterity A crobatics Sleight o f Hand Stealth Intelligence A rcan a History Investigation Nature R eligion W isdom A n im al H andling Insight M edicine Perception Survival Charisma D eception Intim idation P erform an ce P ersu asion For exam ple, if a character attem pts to clim b up a dangerou s cliff, the D u n geon M aster m ight ask for a Strength (Athletics) check . If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bon u s is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she ju st m ak es a Strength check. V a r i a n t : S k i l l s w i t h D i f f e r e n t A b i l i t i e s Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a sp ecific kind o f ability check. P roficiency in Athletics, for exam ple, usually applies to Strength ch eck s. In som e situations, though, your proficiency m ight reasonably apply to a different kind o f check. In such ca ses, the DM might ask for a ch eck u sin g an unusual com bination o f ability and skill, or you m ight ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check . For exam ple, if you have to sw im from an offsh ore island to the m ainland, your D M m ight call for a Constitution ch eck to see if you have the stam ina to m ake it that far. In this case, your DM m ight allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. S o if y ou ’re proficient in A thletics, you apply your proficiency bon u s to the Constitution ch eck ju st as you w ou ld norm ally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, w hen your h alf-orc barbarian u ses a display o f raw strength to intim idate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intim idation) check, even though Intim idation is n orm ally associa ted w ith Charism a. Pa s s i v e C h e c k s A passive ch eck is a sp ecia l kind o f ability ch eck that d o e s n ’t involve any die rolls. S u ch a ch eck can represent the average result for a task d on e repeatedly, such as search in g for secret d o o rs over and over again, or can be used w hen the DM w ants to secretly determ ine w hether the characters su cceed at som eth in g without rollin g dice, such as n oticin g a hidden monster. H ere’s h ow to determ ine a character’s total for a passive check: 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The gam e refers to a passive ch eck total as a score. F or exam ple, if a 1st-level character has a W isd om o f 15 and proficiency in P erception, he or she has a passive W isd om (P erception ) sc o r e o f 14. T h e rules on hiding in the “D exterity” section below rely on passive ch ecks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8. W o r k i n g T o g e t h e r S om etim es tw o or m ore characters team up to attempt a task. T h e character w h o ’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability m odifier—can m ake an ability ch eck with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In com bat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9). A character can only provide help if the task is on e that he or she could attempt alone. For exam ple, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character w h o lacks that proficiency ca n ’t help another character in that task. M oreover, a character can help only when tw o or m ore individuals w orking together w ould actually be productive. S om e tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. G r o u p C h e c k s W h en a num ber o f individuals are trying to a ccom plish som eth in g as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters w h o are skilled at a particular task help cover th ose w h o aren't. To m ake a group ability check, everyone in the group m akes the ability check. If at least h alf the group su cceed s, the w hole group su cceed s. O therw ise, the group fails. G roup ch eck s d on ’t co m e up very often, and they’re m ost useful w hen all the characters su cceed or fail as a group. For exam ple, w hen adventurers are navigating a sw am p, the DM might call for a group W isd om (Survival) ch eck to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sink h oles, and other natural hazards o f the environm ent. If at least h alf the group su cceed s, the su ccessfu l characters are able to guide their com p a n ion s out o f danger. O therw ise, the group stum bles into on e o f these hazards. U s i n g E a c h A b i l i t y Every task that a character or m onster m ight attempt in the gam e is covered by one o f the six abilities. This section explains in m ore detail what those abilities m ean and the w ays they are u sed in the gam e. St r e n g t h Strength m easu res bod ily pow er, athletic training, and the extent to w hich you can exert raw physical force. S t r e n g t h C h e c k s A Strength ch eck can m od el any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break som ething, to force your b od y through a space, or to oth erw ise apply brute force to a situation. The A thletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds o f Strength checks. Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) ch eck covers difficult situations you en cou nter w hile clim bing, jum ping, or sw im m in g. E xam ples include the follow in g activities: • You attempt to clim b a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards w hile scalin g a wall, or clin g to a surface w hile som eth in g is trying to k n ock you off. • You try to ju m p an unusually lon g distance or pull o ff a stunt midjump. • You struggle to sw im or stay afloat in treach erou s cu r­ rents, storm -tossed w aves, or areas o f thick seaw eed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you u nderw a­ ter or oth erw ise interfere w ith your sw im m ing. Other Strength Checks. The DM m ight also call for a Strength ch eck w hen you try to accom plish tasks like the follow ing: • F orce op en a stuck, locked, or barred d oor • B reak free o f bon ds • P ush through a tunnel that is too sm all • H ang on to a w agon w hile bein g d ragged behind it • Tip over a statue • K eep a bou lder from rolling A t t a c k R o l l s a n d D a m a g e You add your Strength m odifier to your attack roll and your dam age roll w hen attacking w ith a m elee w eapon such as a m ace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use m elee w ea p on s to m ake m elee attacks in hand-to-hand com bat, and som e o f them can b e throw n to m ake a ranged attack. L i f t i n g a n d C a r r y i n g Your Strength sc o r e determ ines the am ount o f w eight you can bear. The follow in g term s define w hat you can lift or carry. Carrying Capacity. Your carryin g capacity is your Strength sco re multiplied by 15. This is the w eight (in pounds) that you can carry, w hich is high enough that m ost characters d on ’t usually have to w orry about it. Push, Drag, or Lift. You ca n push, drag, or lift a w eight in pou n d s up to tw ice your carrying capacity (or 30 tim es your Stren gth score). W h ile pushing or dragging w eight in ex ce s s o f your carryin g capacity, your sp eed d rops to 5 feet. Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear m ore w eight, w h ereas Tiny creatu res can carry less. For each size category above M edium , double the creatu re’s carryin g capacity and the am ount it can push, drag, or lift. F or a Tiny creature, halve th ese w eights. Dexterity m ea su res agility, reflexes, and balance. D e x t e r i t y C h e c k s A Dexterity ch eck can m odel any attempt to m ove nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. T h e A crobatics, Sleight o f Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds o f D exterity checks. Acrobatics. Your D exterity (A crobatics) ch eck covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as w hen y ou ’re trying to run a cross a sheet o f ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rock in g ship’s deck. The DM m ight also call for a Dexterity (A crobatics) ch eck to see if you can p erform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, som ersaults, and flips. V a r i a n t : E n c u m b r a n c e The rules for lifting and carryin g are intentionally sim ple. H ere is a variant if you are look in g for m ore detailed rules for determ ining h ow a character is h indered by the w eight o f equipm ent. W h en you use this variant, ignore the Strength colum n o f the A rm or table in chapter 5. If you carry w eight in ex cess o f 5 tim es your Strength score, you are encumbered, w hich m eans your sp eed d rops by 10 feet. If you carry w eight in ex ce s s o f 10 tim es your Strength score, up to your m axim u m carryin g capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, w hich m eans your sp eed d rops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability ch eck s, attack rolls, and saving th row s that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. D e x t e r i t y Sleight o f Hand. W h enever you attempt an act o f legerdem ain or m anual trickery, such as planting som eth in g on so m e o n e else or con cea lin g an object on your p erson , m ake a D exterity (Sleight o f H and) check. The D M m ight also call for a D exterity (Sleight o f H and) ch eck to determ ine w hether you can lift a coin pu rse off another p erson or slip som eth in g out o f another p erson ’s pocket. Stealth. M ake a D exterity (Stealth) ch eck w hen you attempt to con cea l y ou rself from en em ies, slink past guards, slip away w ithout bein g n oticed, or sn eak up on som eon e without being seen or heard. Other Dexterity Checks. T he DM might call for a Dexterity ch eck w hen you try to accom p lish tasks like the follow ing: • C ontrol a heavily laden cart on a steep descen t • S teer a chariot around a tight turn • P ick a lock • D isable a trap • S ecu rely tie up a prison er • W riggle free o f bon d s • Play a stringed instrum ent • Craft a sm all or detailed object A t t a c k R o l l s a n d D a m a g e Y ou add your D exterity m odifier to your attack roll and your dam age roll w hen attacking w ith a ranged w eapon, such as a sling or a longbow . You can also add your D exterity m odifier to your attack roll and your dam age roll w hen attacking with a m elee w ea p on that has the fin esse property, such as a dagger or a rapier. H i d i n g When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check o f any creature that actively searches for signs o f your presence. You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs o f danger all around, so if you come out o f hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen. Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus o f +2) has a Wisdom o f 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) o f 14. What Can You See? One o f the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8. A r m o r G l a s s D epen d in g on the arm or you wear, you might add som e or all o f your Dexterity m odifier to your A rm or Class, as d escrib ed in chapter 5. I n i t i a t i v e At the begin n in g o f every com bat, you roll initiative by m aking a D exterity check. Initiative determ ines the order o f creatu res’ turns in com bat, as d escrib ed in chapter 9. C o n s t i t u t i o n Constitution m easu res health, stam ina, and vital force. C o n s t i t u t i o n C h e c k s Constitution ch eck s are u n com m on , and no skills apply to Constitution checks, b eca u se the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a sp ecific effort on the part o f a character or monster. A C onstitution ch eck can m od el your attempt to push beyon d norm al limits, however. T h e DM m ight call for a Constitution ch eck w hen you try to a ccom plish tasks like the follow ing: • H old your breath • M arch or labor for hours w ithout rest • G o w ithout sleep • Survive w ithout fo o d or water • Q uaff an entire stein o f ale in on e go H i t P o i n t s Your Constitution m odifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution m odifier to each Hit D ie you roll for your hit points. If your Constitution m odifier changes, your hit point m axim u m changes as w ell, as though you had the new m odifier from 1st level. For exam ple, if you raise your Constitution sc o r e w hen you reach 4th level and your Constitution m odifier in crea ses from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point m axim u m as though the m odifier had always b een +2. S o you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your n ew modifier. Or if you ’re 7th level and som e effect low ers your Constitution sco re s o as to reduce your Constitution m odifier by 1, your hit point m axim u m is reduced by 7. I n t e l l i g e n c e Intelligence m easu res m ental acuity, accu racy o f recall, and the ability to reason. I n t e l l i g e n c e C h e c k s A n Intelligence ch eck c o m e s into play w hen you need to draw on logic, education, m em ory, or deductive reasoning. T h e A rcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and R eligion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds o f Intelligence checks. Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) ch eck m easu res your ability to recall lore about spells, m agic items, eldritch sym bols, m agical traditions, the planes o f existence, and the inhabitants o f th ose planes. History. Your Intelligence (H istory) ch eck m easu res your ability to recall lore about h istorical events, legendary people, ancient k in gdom s, past disputes, recent w ars, and lost civilizations. Investigation. W h en you look around for clues and m ake deductions based on th ose clues, you m ake an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You m ight dedu ce the location o f a hidden object, discern from the appearan ce o f a w oun d w hat kind o f w eap on dealt it, or determ ine the w eakest point in a tunnel that cou ld cau se it to collap se. P orin g through ancient scrolls in sea rch o f a hidden fragm ent o f kn ow led ge m ight also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) ch eck m easu res your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and anim als, the weather, and natural cycles. Religion. Your Intelligence (R eligion) ch eck m easu res your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy sym bols, and the practices o f secret cults. Other Intelligence Checks. The DM m ight call for an Intelligence ch eck w hen you try to accom plish tasks like the follow ing: • C om m u nicate with a creature w ithout using w ord s • Estim ate the value o f a p reciou s item • Pull together a disgu ise to pass as a city guard • F orge a docum ent • R eca ll lore about a craft or trade • W in a gam e o f skill S p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y W izards use Intelligence as their sp ellcastin g ability, w hich helps determ ine the saving throw D C s o f sp ells they cast. W i s d o m W isd om reflects h ow attuned you are to the w orld around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition. W i s d o m C h e c k s A W isd om ch eck m ight reflect an effort to read b od y language, understand s o m e o n e ’s feelings, n otice things about the environm ent, or care for an injured person. T h e A nim al Handling, Insight, M edicine, P erception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds o f W isd om checks. Animal Handling. W h en there is any question w hether you can calm dow n a dom esticated animal, keep a m ount from getting sp ooked , or intuit an anim al’s intentions, the DM m ight call for a W isd om (Anim al Handling) check. You also m ake a W isd om (Anim al Handling) ch eck to control your m ount w hen you attempt a risky maneuver. Insight. Your W isd om (Insight) ch eck d ecid es w hether you can determ ine the true intentions o f a creature, such as w h en search in g out a lie or predicting s o m e o n e ’s next m ove. D oin g s o involves glean in g clues from b od y language, sp eech habits, and ch a n g es in m annerism s. Medicine. A W isd om (M edicine) ch eck lets you try to stabilize a dying com pa n ion or d ia gn ose an illness. Perception. Your W isd om (Perception) ch eck lets you spot, hear, or oth erw ise detect the presen ce of som ething. It m easu res your general aw areness o f your surroundings and the keen ness o f your sen ses. F i n d i n g a H i d d e n O b j e c t When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook. In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance o f success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set o f folded clothes in the top drawer o f a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance o f finding the key, regardless o f your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance o f success. For exam ple, you m ight try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an op en window, or hear m on sters m oving stealthily in the forest. O r you m ight try to spot things that are ob scu red or easy to m iss, w hether they are orc s lying in am bush on a road, thugs hiding in the sh ad ow s o f an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door. Survival. T h e DM m ight ask you to m ake a W isd om (Survival) ch eck to follow tracks, hunt w ild gam e, guide your group through frozen w astelands, identify signs that ow lbea rs live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. Other Wisdom Checks. The D M m ight call for a W isd om ch eck w hen you try to accom p lish tasks like the follow ing: • G et a gut feeling about w hat co u rse o f action to follow • D iscern w hether a seem in gly dead or living creature is undead S p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y C lerics, druids, and rangers use W isd om as their spellcastin g ability, w h ich helps determ ine the saving th row D C s o f sp ells they cast. C h a r i s m a C harism a m easu res your ability to interact effectively w ith others. It includes such factors as con fid en ce and eloqu en ce, and it can represent a charm ing or com m a n d in g personality. C h a r i s m a C h e c k s A C harism a ch eck m ight arise w hen you try to influence or entertain others, w hen you try to m ake an im pression or tell a con vin cin g lie, or w hen you are navigating a tricky socia l situation. T h e D eception , Intim idation, P erform an ce, and P ersu asion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds o f C harism a checks. Deception. Your C harism a (D eception ) ch eck determ ines w hether you can convin cin gly hide the truth, either verbally o r through your actions. This deception can en com p a ss everything from m isleading others through am biguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a m erchant, earn m on ey through gam bling, pa ss you rself o ff in a disguise, dull s o m e o n e ’s su sp icion s w ith false assu ran ces, or m aintain a straight face w hile telling a blatant lie. Intimidation. W h en you attempt to influence som eon e through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violen ce, the D M m ight ask you to m ake a C harism a (Intim idation) check. E xam ples include trying to pry inform ation out o f a prisoner, con vin cin g street thugs to ba ck d ow n from a confrontation, or using the edge o f a broken bottle to con v in ce a sn eerin g vizier to recon sid er a decision. Perform ance. Your C harism a (P erform a n ce) ch eck determ ines h ow w ell you can delight an audience with m usic, dance, acting, storytelling, or som e other form o f entertainm ent. Persuasion. W h en you attempt to influence som eon e or a group o f p eop le w ith tact, so cia l graces, or g ood nature, the D M might ask you to m ake a C harism a (P ersu asion) check. Typically, you use persu asion w hen acting in g o o d faith, to foster friendships, m ake cordial requests, or exhibit p roper etiquette. E xam ples o f persu ading others include con vin cin g a cham berlain to let your party see the king, negotiating p e a ce betw een w arrin g tribes, or inspiring a crow d o f tow nsfolk. Other Charisma Checks. T h e D M m ight call for a C harism a ch eck w hen you try to a ccom plish tasks like the follow ing: • Find the best p erson to talk to for new s, rum ors, and gossip • Blend into a crow d to get the sen se o f key topics o f conversation S p e l l c a s t i n g A b i l i t y Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlock s use Charism a as their sp ellcastin g ability, w hich helps determ ine the saving th row D C s o f sp ells they cast. Sa v i n g T h r o w s A saving th row —also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a p oison , a disease, or a sim ilar threat. You d on ’t norm ally d ecide to m ake a saving throw ; you are forced to m ake on e b eca u se your character or m on ster is at risk o f harm. To m ake a saving throw, roll a d2 0 and add the appropriate ability m odifier. F or exam ple, you u se your D exterity m odifier for a D exterity saving throw. A saving th row can be m od ified by a situational bon u s or penalty and ca n be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determ ined by the DM. E ach class gives proficiency in at least tw o saving throw s. T h e w izard, for exam ple, is proficient in Intelligence saves. A s w ith skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throw s m ade using a particular ability score. S om e m onsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. T h e Difficulty C lass for a saving th row is determ ined by the effect that ca u ses it. F or exam ple, the D C for a saving th row allow ed by a spell is determ ined by the caster’s sp ellcastin g ability and proficiency bonus. T h e result o f a su ccessfu l or failed saving th row is a lso detailed in the effect that allow s the save. Usually, a su ccessfu l save m ea n s that a creature suffers no harm , or redu ced harm , from an effect. C h a p t e r 8 : A d v e n t u r i n g DELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS. slipping through the b a ck alleys o f W aterdeep, h acking a fresh trail through the thick ju n g les on the Isle o f D rea d—these are the things that D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s adventures are m ade of. Your character in the gam e m ight explore forgotten ruins and u ncharted lands, u ncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul m onsters. A nd if all g oes w ell, your character w ill survive to claim rich rew ards before em barking on a n ew adventure. T h is chapter covers the ba sics o f the adventuring life, from the m ech an ics o f m ovem ent to the com plexities o f so cia l interaction. T h e rules for resting are also in this chapter, along w ith a discu ssion o f the activities your character might pursue b etw een adventures. W h eth er adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the com p lex relationships o f a royal court, the gam e follow s a natural rhythm, as outlined in the b o o k ’s introduction: 1. T h e DM d escrib es the environm ent. 2. T h e players d escrib e w hat they w ant to do. 3. The DM narrates the results o f their actions. Typically, the D M u ses a m ap as an outline o f the adventure, tracking the characters’ p rogress as they explore du ngeon corrid ors or w ild ern ess regions. T h e D M ’s notes, including a key to the map, describe w hat the adventurers find as they enter each n ew area. S om etim es, the pa ssa ge o f tim e and the adventurers’ actions determ ine what happens, s o the DM might u se a tim eline or a flow chart to track their progress instead o f a map. T i m e In situations w h ere keepin g track o f the pa ssa ge of tim e is im portant, the DM determ ines the tim e a task requires. T h e D M m ight use a different tim e scale depen din g on the context o f the situation at hand. In a du ngeon environm ent, the adventurers’ m ovem ent happens on a scale o f minutes. It takes them about a m inute to creep dow n a long hallway, another m inute to ch e ck for traps on the d oor at the end o f the hall, and a g o o d ten m inutes to sea rch the ch a m ber beyon d for anything interesting or valuable. In a city o r w ildern ess, a scale o f hours is often m ore appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tow er at the heart o f the forest hurry a cross th ose fifteen m iles in ju st under four h ou rs’ time. F or lon g jou rneys, a sca le o f days w ork s best. F ollow in g the road from B aldur’s Gate to W aterdeep, the adventurers sp en d four uneventful days before a goblin am bush interrupts their journey. In com bat and other fast-paced situations, the gam e relies on rounds, a 6 -secon d span o f tim e d escrib ed in chapter 9. M o v e m e n t S w im m in g a cross a rushing river, sn eaking dow n a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous m ountain s l o p e - all sorts o f m ovem ent play a key role in D&D adventures. The DM can su m m arize the adventurers’ m ovem ent w ithout calculating exact dista n ces or travel tim es: “You travel through the forest and find the du ngeon entrance late in the evening o f the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large du ngeon or a cave netw ork, the DM can su m m arize m ovem ent b etw een encounters: “A fter killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dw arven stronghold, you consult your map, w hich leads you through m iles o f ech oin g corrid ors to a chasm bridged by a n arrow stone arch.” S om etim es it’s im portant, though, to kn ow h ow long it takes to get from on e sp ot to another, w hether the answ er is in days, hours, or minutes. T h e rules for determ ining travel tim e depen d on tw o factors: the sp eed and travel pa ce o f the creatures m ovin g and the terrain they're m oving over. S p e e d Every character and m onster has a sp eed, w h ich is the distance in feet that the character or m onster can w alk in 1 round. This num ber a ssu m es short bursts o f energetic m ovem ent in the m idst o f a life- threatening situation. T h e follow in g rules determ ine h ow far a character or m on ster can m ove in a minute, an hour, or a day. T r a v e l Pa c e W h ile traveling, a group o f adventurers can m ove at a norm al, fast, or slow pace, as sh ow n on the Travel P ace table. The table states h ow far the party can m ove in a p eriod o f tim e and w hether the p a ce has any effect. A fast p a ce m a kes characters less perceptive, w hile a slow pace m akes it p ossib le to sn eak around and to sea rch an area m ore carefully (see the “Activity W h ile Traveling” section later in this chapter for m ore inform ation). Forced March. T h e Travel P ace table assu m es that characters travel for 8 h ours in day. They can push on beyon d that limit, at the risk o f exhaustion. For each additional hour o f travel beyon d 8 hours, the characters cover the distance sh ow n in the H our colu m n for their pace, and each character m ust m ake a Constitution saving th row at the end o f the hour. The D C is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level o f exhaustion (see appendix A). Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans o f tim e (up to an hour), m any anim als m ove m uch faster than hum anoids. A m ounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, coverin g tw ice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh m ounts are available every 8 to 10 m iles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas. Characters in w agons, carriages, or other land veh icles c h o o s e a pa ce as norm al. C haracters in a w aterborn e v essel are lim ited to the sp eed o f the vessel (see chapter 5), and they d on ’t suffer penalties for a fast p a ce or gain benefits from a slow pace. D epen d in g on the v essel and the size o f the crew , ships m ight be able to travel for up to 24 hours p er day. Certain sp ecia l m ounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or sp ecia l vehicles, such as a carpet o f flying, allow you to travel m ore swiftly. T h e Dungeon Master’s Guide contain s m ore inform ation on sp ecia l m ethods o f travel. D i f f i c u l t T e r r a i n T h e travel sp eed s given in the Travel P a ce table assu m e relatively sim ple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear du ngeon corridors. But adventurers often face den se forests, deep sw am ps, rubble-filled ruins, steep m ountains, and ice-cov ered grou n d—all con sidered difficult terrain. You m ove at h alf sp eed in difficult terrain—m oving 1 foot in difficult terrain c o sts 2 feet o f sp e e d —s o you can cover only h alf the n orm al distance in a minute, an hour, or a day. S p e c i a l T y p e s o f M o v e m e n t M ovem ent through dangerou s du ngeon s or w ildern ess areas often involves m ore than sim ply w alking.

C l i m b i n g , S w i m m i n g , a n d C r a w l i n g W h ile clim bin g or sw im m in g, each foot o f m ovem ent co sts 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a clim bin g or sw im m in g speed. At the D M ’s option, clim bin g a slippery vertical su rface or one w ith few h andholds requ ires a su ccessfu l Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a su ccessfu l Strength (Athletics) check. J u m p i n g Y our Strength determ ines h ow far you can jum p. Long Jump. W h en you m ake a long ju m p, you cover a n um ber o f feet up to your Strength sc o r e if you m ove at least 10 feet on foot im m ediately before the jum p. W h en you m ake a standing long jum p, you can leap only h alf that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the ju m p c o sts a foot o f m ovem ent. T his rule a ssu m es that the height o f your ju m p d oesn ’t matter, such as a ju m p a cro ss a stream or chasm . At your D M ’s option, you must su cce e d on a D C 10 Strength (Athletics) ch eck to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter o f the ju m p ’s distance), su ch as a h edge or low w all. O therw ise, you hit it. W h en you land in difficult terrain, you m ust su cceed on a D C 10 D exterity (A crobatics) ch eck to land on your feet. O therw ise, you land prone. High Jump. W h en you m ake a high jum p, you leap into the air a num ber o f feet equal to 3 + your Strength m odifier if you m ove at least 10 feet on foot im m ediately before the jum p. W h en you m ake a standing high jum p, you can ju m p only h alf that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the ju m p c o sts a foot o f m ovem ent. In som e circu m stan ces, your DM m ight allow you to m ake a Strength (Athletics) ch eck to ju m p higher than you norm ally can. You can extend your arm s h alf your height above y ou rself during the jum p. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height o f the ju m p plus 1 1/2 tim es your height. A c t i v i t y W h i l e T r a v e l i n g A s adventurers travel through a du ngeon or the w ildern ess, they n eed to rem ain alert for danger, and so m e characters m ight p erform other tasks to help the grou p’s journey. M a r c h i n g O r d e r T he adventurers sh ou ld establish a m arch ing order. A m arch ing order m akes it easier to determ ine w hich characters are affected by traps, w h ich on es ca n spot hidden en em ies, and w hich on es are the closest to those en em ies w hen a fight breaks out. A character m ight occu p y the front rank, one or m ore m iddle ranks, or the back rank. C haracters in the front and ba ck ranks n eed en ough r oom to travel side by side w ith others in their rank. W h en sp ace is too tight, the m arch ing order must change, usually by m oving characters to a m iddle rank. Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its m arching order with only tw o ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If th ere’s only on e rank, it’s con sid ered a front rank. S t e a l t h W h ile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can m ove stealthily. A s lon g as they’re not in the open, they can try to su rprise or sn eak by other creatures they encounter.

If the D M determ ines that the adventurers en cou nter other creatures w hile they’re traveling, it’s up to both grou ps to d ecide w hat happens next. Either group m ight d ecide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see w hat the other group does. Surprising Foes. If the adventurers en cou nter a hostile creature or group, the DM determ ines w hether the adventurers or their fo e s might b e su rprised w hen com bat erupts. S e e chapter 9 for m ore about surprise. O t h e r A c t i v i t i e s C haracters w h o turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focu sed on w atching for danger. T h ese characters don ’t contribute their passive W isd om (P erception ) s c o r e s to the grou p’s ch a n ce o f n oticing h idden threats. However, a character not w atching for danger can d o on e o f the follow in g activities instead, or so m e other activity with the D M ’s perm ission . Navigate. T h e character can try to prevent the group from b e co m in g lost, m akin g a W isd om (Survival) ch eck w hen the D M calls for it. (T h e Dungeon Master’s Guide h as rules to determ ine w hether the group gets lost.) Draw a Map. T h e character can draw a m ap that record s the grou p’s p rog ress and helps the characters get ba ck on co u rse if they get lost. N o ability ch eck is required. Track. A character can follow the tracks o f another creature, m ak in g a W isd om (Survival) ch eck w hen the D M calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for tracking.) Forage. T h e character can keep an eye out for ready s o u rce s o f fo o d and water, m aking a W isd om (Survival) ch eck w h en the DM calls for it. (T h e Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for foraging.) T h e E n v i r o n m e n t By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerou s, and full o f m ysteries to be explored. T h e rules in this section cover so m e o f the m ost im portant w ays in w h ich adventurers interact with the environm ent in such places. T h e Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules coverin g m ore unusual situations. F a l l i n g A fall from a great height is one o f the m ost com m on h azards facing an adventurer. At the end o f a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeon ing dam age for every 10 feet it fell, to a m axim u m o f 20d6. T h e creature lands prone, u nless it avoids taking dam age from the fall. S u f f o c a t i n g A creature can hold its breath for a num ber o f m inutes equal to 1 + its Constitution m odifier (m inim um o f 30 secon ds). W h en a creature runs out o f breath, it can survive for a num ber o f roun ds equal to its Constitution m odifier (m inim um 1 round). At the start o f its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. S p l i t t i n g U p t h e P a r t y Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks. The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event o f an attack. The advantage is that a small group o f stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf paladin friend behind. For exam ple, a creature w ith a Constitution o f 14 can hold its breath for 3 m inutes. If it starts suffocating, it h as 2 roun ds to reach air before it d rops to 0 hit points. V i s i o n a n d L i g h t The m ost fundam ental tasks o f adventuring—n oticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enem y in com bat, and targeting a spell, to nam e ju st a few — rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. D arkness and other effects that ob scu re vision can prove a significant hindrance. A given area m ight be lightly or heavily ob scu red. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or m oderate foliage, creatu res have disadvantage on W isd om (P erception ) ch eck s that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or den se foliage—b lock s vision entirely. A creature in a heavily ob scu red area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A). T h e p resen ce or ab sen ce o f light in an environm ent creates three categories o f illum ination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets m ost creatu res see norm ally. Even gloom y days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sou rces o f illum ination w ithin a sp ecific radius. Dim light, also called sh adow s, creates a lightly ob scu red area. A n area o f dim light is usually a bou n dary b etw een a so u rce o f bright light, such as a torch, and su rrou nding darkness. T h e soft light o f twilight and dawn also coun ts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full m oon m ight bathe the land in dim light. Darkness creates a heavily o b scu red area. C haracters face darkn ess ou tdoors at night (even m ost m oonlit nights), w ithin the con fin es o f an unlit du ngeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area o f m agical darkness. B l i n d s i g h t A creature w ith blindsight can perceive its surrou ndings w ithout relying on sight, w ithin a sp ecific radius. Creatures w ithout eyes, such as oo ze s , and creatures w ith ech olocation or heightened sen ses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sen se. D a r k v i s i o n M any creatu res in the w orld s o f D&D, esp ecia lly th ose that dw ell underground, have darkvision. W ithin a sp ecified range, a creature w ith darkvision can see in darkn ess as if the darkn ess w ere dim light, s o areas o f darkn ess are only lightly ob scu red as far as that creature is con cern ed . However, the creature ca n ’t discern color in darkness, only sh ad es o f gray. T r u e s i g h t A creature w ith truesight can, out to a sp ecific range, see in norm al and m agical darkness, see invisible creatu res and objects, autom atically detect visual illusions and su cce e d on saving th row s against them, and perceives the original form o f a sh ap ech an ger or a creature that is tran sform ed by m agic. Furtherm ore, the creature can see into the E thereal Plane. F o o d a n d W a t e r C haracters w h o d on ’t eat or drink suffer the effects o f exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion cau sed by lack o f fo o d or water ca n ’t b e rem oved until the character eats and drinks the full requ ired am ount. F o o d A character n eeds on e pou n d o f food p er day and can m ake fo o d last longer by subsisting on h alf rations. Eating h alf a pou n d o f fo o d in a day coun ts as h alf a day w ithout food. A character can go w ithout fo o d for a num ber o f days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution m odifier (m inim um 1). At the end o f each day beyon d that limit, a character autom atically suffers on e level o f exhaustion. A n orm al day o f eating resets the coun t o f days w ithout food to zero. W a t e r A character n eed s one gallon o f water per day, or tw o gallons per day if the w eath er is hot. A character w ho drinks only h alf that m uch water m ust su cce e d on a D C 15 Constitution saving th row o r suffer one level o f exhaustion at the end o f the day. A character w ith a cce ss to even less w ater autom atically suffers one level o f exhaustion at the end o f the day. If the character already has one or m ore levels o f exhaustion, the character takes tw o levels in either case. I n t e r a c t i n g w i t h O b j e c t s A character’s interaction w ith ob jects in an environm ent is often sim ple to resolve in the gam e. T h e player tells the D M that his or her character is doin g som ething, su ch a m oving a lever, and the DM d escrib es what, if anything happens. F or exam ple, a character m ight d ecide to pull a lever, w h ich might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cau se a ro o m to flood w ith water, or op en a secret d oor in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character m ight n eed to force it. In such a situation, the D M might call for a Strength ch eck to see w hether the character can w ren ch the lever into place. T h e D M sets the D C for any such ch eck ba sed on the difficulty o f the task. C haracters can also dam age objects with their w ea p on s and spells. O bjects are im m une to p oison and psychic dam age, but oth erw ise they can be affected by physical and m agical attacks m uch like creatures can. The D M determ ines an o b je ct’s A rm or C lass and hit points, and might d ecide that certain objects have resistan ce or im m unity to certain kinds o f attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rop e w ith a club, for exam ple.) O bjects always fail Strength and D exterity saving throw s, and they are im m une to effects that require other saves. W h en an object d rops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a Strength ch eck to break an object. T h e D M sets the D C for any such check. S o c i a l I n t e r a c t i o n E xplorin g dungeons, overcom in g obstacles, and slaying m on sters are key parts o f D & D adventures. N o less im portant, though, are the socia l interactions that adventurers have w ith other inhabitants o f the w orld. Interaction takes on m any form s. You might need to con v in ce an u n scrupulou s th ief to co n fe s s to som e m alfeasan ce, or you m ight try to flatter a dragon s o that it w ill spare your life. The DM a ssu m es the roles o f any characters w h o are participating in the interaction that don ’t belon g to another player at the table. A n y such character is called a nonplayer character (N PC ). In general term s, an N P C ’s attitude tow ard you is d escrib ed as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly N P C s are p red isp osed to help you, and hostile on es are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you w ant from a friendly N PC , o f cou rse. S o c ia l interactions have tw o prim ary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks. R o l e p l a y i n g R oleplaying is, literally, the act o f playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determ ining h ow your character thinks, acts, and talks. R oleplaying is a part o f every aspect o f the gam e, and it c o m e s to the fore during socia l interactions. Your character’s quirks, m ann erism s, and personality influence h ow interactions resolve. T h ere are tw o styles you can u se w hen roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. M ost players u se a com bination o f the tw o styles. U se w hichever m ix o f the tw o w ork s best for you. D e s c r i p t i v e A p p r o a c h t o R o l e p l a y i n g W ith this approach, you d escrib e your character’s w ord s and actions to the DM and the other players. D raw ing on your mental im age o f your character, you tell everyone w hat your character d o e s and h ow he or she d o e s it. F or instance, Chris plays T ordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick tem per and blam es the elves o f the C loa k w ood for his fam ily’s m isfortune. At a tavern, an obn ox iou s elf m instrel sits at T ordek ’s table and tries to strike up a conversation w ith the dwarf. C hris says, “T ordek spits on the floor, grow ls an insult at the bard, and stom ps over to the bar. H e sits on a stool and glares at the m instrel b efore ordering another drink.” In this exam ple, Chris has conveyed T ordek’s m ood and given the DM a clear idea o f his character’s attitude and actions. W h en using descriptive roleplaying, keep the follow in g things in mind: • D escrib e your character’s em otion s and attitude. • F ocu s on your character’s intent and h ow others m ight perceive it. • Provide as m uch em bellishm ent as you feel com fortab le with. D on ’t w orry about getting things exactly right. Just focu s on thinking about w hat your character w ould do and d escribin g w hat you see in your m ind. A c t i v e A p p r o a c h t o R o l e p l a y i n g If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players w hat your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them. W h en you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s m ovem ents and body language. T h is approach is m ore im m ersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still n eed to d escrib e things that ca n ’t be reason ably acted out. G oin g back to the exam ple o f Chris roleplaying Tordek above, h ere’s h ow the scen e m ight play out if Chris used active roleplaying: S p eak in g as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I w as w on derin g w hy it suddenly sm elled aw ful in here. If I w anted to hear anything out o f you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screa m s.” In his n orm al voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.” R e s u l t s o f R o l e p l a y i n g T h e DM u ses your character’s actions and attitudes to determ ine h ow an N P C reacts. A cow a rdly N P C bu ckles under threats o f violence. A stubborn dw arf refu ses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery. W h en interacting with an N PC , pay clo se attention to the D M ’s portrayal o f the N P C ’s m ood , dialogue, and personality. You m ight b e able to determ ine an N P C ’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bon ds, then play on them to influence the N P C ’s attitude. Interactions in D & D are m uch like interactions in real life. If you can offer N P C s som eth in g they want, threaten them w ith som eth in g they fear, or play on their sym pathies and goals, you can u se w ord s to get alm ost anything you want. O n the other hand, if you insult a proud w arrior or sp eak ill o f a n oble’s allies, your efforts to con v in ce or deceive w ill fall short. A b i l i t y C h e c k s In addition to roleplaying, ability ch eck s are key in determ ining the ou tcom e o f an interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an N P C ’s attitude, but there might still be an elem ent o f ch a n ce in the situation. For exam ple, your DM can call for a Charism a ch eck at any point during an interaction if he or she w ants the d ice to play a role in determ ining an N P C ’s reactions. Other ch eck s m ight be appropriate in certain situations, at your D M ’s discretion. Pay attention to your skill proficiencies w hen thinking o f h ow you w ant to interact with an N PC , and stack the d eck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bon u ses and skills. If the group n eed s to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue w h o is proficient in D eception is the best bet to lead the discu ssion . W h en negotiating for a h osta ge’s release, the cleric w ith P ersu asion should do m ost o f the talking. R e s t i n g H eroic though they m ight be, adventurers ca n ’t spend every h our o f the day in the thick o f exploration, socia l interaction, and com bat. They n eed rest—tim e to sleep and eat, tend their w ounds, refresh their m inds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace them selves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the m idst o f an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. S h o r t R e s t A short rest is a p eriod o f dow ntim e, at least 1 hour long, during w h ich a character d oes nothing m ore strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to w ounds. A character can spend on e or m ore Hit D ice at the end o f a short rest, up to the character’s m axim u m num ber o f Hit D ice, w hich is equal to the character's level. For each Hit D ie spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution m odifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit D ie after each roll. A character regains so m e spent Hit D ice u pon finishing a lon g rest, as explained below. L o n g R e s t A lon g rest is a p eriod o f extended dow ntim e, at least 8 h ours long, during w h ich a character sleep s or perform s light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for n o m ore than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a p eriod o f strenuous activity—at least 1 hour o f w alking, fighting, castin g spells, or sim ilar adventuring activity— the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end o f a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. T h e character also regains spent Hit D ice, up to a num ber o f dice equal to h alf o f the character’s total num ber o f them. For exam ple, if a character has eight Hit D ice, he or she can regain four spent Hit D ice upon finishing a lon g rest. A character ca n ’t benefit from m ore than on e long rest in a 24-hou r period, and a character m ust have at least 1 hit point at the start o f the rest to gain its benefits. B e t w e e n A d v e n t u r e s B etw een trips to du ngeon s and battles against ancient evils, adventurers n eed tim e to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. M any adventurers also use this tim e to perform other tasks, such as crafting arm s and armor, perform in g research, or spending their hard-earned gold. In som e ca ses, the pa ssage o f tim e is som eth in g that o c cu rs w ith little fanfare or description. W h en starting a n ew adventure, the DM might sim ply declare that a certain am ount o f tim e has pa ssed and allow you to d escrib e in general term s w hat your character has b een doing. At other tim es, the D M m ight w ant to keep track o f ju st h ow m uch tim e is passin g as events beyond your p erception stay in m otion. L i f e s t y l e E x p e n s e s B etw een adventures, you c h o o s e a particular quality o f life and pay the co st o f m aintaining that lifestyle, as d escrib ed in chapter 5. Living a particular lifestyle d oesn ’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the w ay other individuals and groups react to you. For exam ple, w h en you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it m ight be easier for you to influence the n obles o f the city than if you live in poverty. D o w n t i m e A c t i v i t i e s B etw een adventures, the DM might ask you w hat your character is doin g during his or her dow ntim e. P eriods o f dow ntim e can vary in duration, but each dow ntim e activity requ ires a certain num ber o f days to com plete b efore you gain any benefit, and at least 8 h ours o f each day m ust be spent on the dow ntim e activity for the day to count. T h e days d o not need to be consecu tive. If you have m ore than the m inim um am ount o f days to spend, you ca n k eep doin g the sam e thing for a longer period o f tim e, or sw itch to a n ew dow ntim e activity. D ow n tim e activities other than the on es presented b elow are possible. If you w ant y ou r character to spend his or her dow ntim e perform in g an activity not covered here, d iscu ss it w ith your DM. C r a f t i n g Y ou can craft n onm agical objects, including adventuring equipm ent and w ork s o f art. You m ust be proficient w ith tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You m ight also n eed a c c e s s to sp ecia l m aterials or locations n ecessa ry to create it. F or exam ple, som eon e proficient w ith sm ith’s tools n eeds a forge in order to craft a sw ord or suit o f armor. F or every day o f dow ntim e you spend crafting, you can craft on e or m ore item s w ith a total m arket value not ex ceed in g 5 gp, and you m ust expend raw m aterials w orth h alf the total m arket value. If som eth in g you w ant to craft has a m arket value greater than 5 gp, you m ake p rog ress every day in 5-gp increm ents until you reach the m arket value o f the item. F or exam ple, a suit o f plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) takes 3 0 0 days to craft by yourself. Multiple characters can com bin e their efforts tow ard the crafting o f a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency w ith the requisite tools and are w ork in g together in the sam e place. E ach character contributes 5 gp w orth o f effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. F or exam ple, three characters w ith the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities ca n craft a suit o f plate arm or in 100 days, at a total co st o f 750 gp. W h ile crafting, you can m aintain a m od est lifestyle w ithout having to pay 1 gp per day, or a com fortable lifestyle at half the norm al cost (see chapter 5 for m ore inform ation on lifestyle expenses). P r a c t i c i n g a P r o f e s s i o n You can w ork betw een adventures, allow ing you to maintain a m odest lifestyle w ithout having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for m ore inform ation on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a m em ber o f an organization that can provide gainful em ploym ent, such as a tem ple or a thieves’ guild, you earn en ough to support a com fortab le lifestyle instead. If you have proficiency in the P erform an ce skill and put your perform an ce skill to u se during your dow ntim e, you earn en ough to support a w ealthy lifestyle instead. R e c u p e r a t i n g You can u se dow ntim e b etw een adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. A fter three days o f d ow ntim e spent recuperating, you can m ake a D C 15 Constitution saving throw. O n a su ccessfu l save, you can c h o o s e on e o f the follow in g results: • End one effect on you that prevents you from regain­ ing hit points. • F or the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving th row s against one d isease or p oison currently affecting you. R e s e a r c h i n g T h e tim e betw een adventures is a great ch a n ce to p erform research, gaining insight into m ysteries that have unfurled over the co u rse o f the cam paign. R esea rch can include p orin g over dusty tom es and cru m blin g scrolls in a library o r buying drinks for the loca ls to pry ru m ors and gossip from their lips. W h en you begin your research, the DM determ ines w hether the inform ation is available, h ow m any days o f dow ntim e it w ill take to find it, and w hether there are any restriction s on your research (such as n eed in g to seek out a sp ecific individual, tom e, or location). The D M m ight also require you to m ake one or m ore ability ch ecks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) ch eck to find clues pointing tow ard the inform ation you seek, or a Charism a (P ersu asion) ch eck to secu re so m e o n e ’s aid. O n ce th ose condition s are met, you learn the inform ation if it is available. F or each day o f research, you m ust spend 1 gp to cover your expen ses. T h is co st is in addition to your n orm al lifestyle ex p en ses (as d iscu ssed in chapter 5). T r a i n i n g You can spend time b etw een adventures learning a n ew language or training w ith a set o f tools. Your DM m ight allow additional training options. First, you m ust find an instructor w illing to teach you. T h e DM determ ines h ow lon g it takes, and w hether one or m ore ability ch eck s are required. The training lasts for 2 5 0 days and co sts 1 gp per day. After you sp en d the requisite am ount o f tim e and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the n ew tool. C h a p t e r 9: C o m b a t THE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST a shield. T h e terrible rending sou n d as m on strou s claw s tear through armor.

R oa rs o f fury, shouts o f triumph, cries o f pain. C om bat in D & D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling. T h is chapter p rovides the rules you need for your characters and m on sters to engage in com bat, w hether it is a brief skirm ish or an extended conflict in a du ngeon or on a field o f battle. T h rou gh ou t this chapter, the rules address you, the player or D u n geon Master. T he D u n geon M aster con trols all the m on sters and nonplayer characters involved in com bat, and each other player con trols an adventurer. “Y ou” can also m ean the character or m onster that you control. T h e O r d e r o f C o m b a t A typical com bat en cou nter is a clash b etw een tw o sides, a flurry o f w ea p on sw ings, feints, parries, footw ork, and spellcasting. The gam e organizes the ch a os o f com bat into a cycle o f roun ds and turns. A round represents about 6 se co n d s in the gam e w orld. D uring a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. Th e order o f turns is determ ined at the begin ning o f a com bat encounter, w hen everyone rolls initiative. O n ce everyone has taken a turn, the fight continu es to the next round if neither side has defeated the other. S u r p r i s e A band o f adventurers sn eaks up on a bandit cam p, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cu b e glides dow n a du ngeon passage, u nn oticed by the adventurers until the cu b e en gu lfs one o f them. In th ese situations, one side o f the battle gains surprise over the other. Th e DM determ ines w h o m ight be su rprised. If neither side tries to b e stealthy, they autom atically n otice each other. O therw ise, the DM com p a res the Dexterity (Stealth) ch eck s o f anyone hiding w ith the passive W isd om (P erception ) sco re o f each creature on the C o m b a t S t e p b y S t e p 1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. 2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are— how far away and in what direction. 3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order o f combatants’ turns. 4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order. 5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops. op p osin g side. Any character o r m onster that d oesn ’t n otice a threat is su rprised at the start o f the encounter. If you ’re su rprised, you can ’t m ove or take an action on your first turn o f the com bat, and you ca n ’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A m em ber o f a group can b e surprised even if the other m em bers aren’t. I n i t i a t i v e Initiative determ ines the order o f turns during com bat. W h en com bat starts, every participant m akes a D exterity ch eck to determ ine their place in the initiative order. The DM m akes one roll for an entire group o f identical creatures, so each m em ber o f the group acts at the sam e time. The DM ranks the com batants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity ch eck total to the on e w ith the low est. This is the order (called the initiative order) in w hich they act during each round. T h e initiative order rem ains the sam e from round to round. If a tie occu rs, the DM d ecides the order am ong tied D M -controlled creatures, and the players decide the order am ong their tied characters. T h e D M can d ecide the order if the tie is b etw een a m onster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and m on sters each roll a d2 0 to determ ine the order, highest roll going first. Y o u r T u r n On your turn, you can move a distance up to your sp eed and take one action. You d ecide w hether to m ove first or take your action first. Your sp eed —som etim es called your w alkin g sp eed —is noted on your character sheet. T h e m ost co m m o n actions you can take are d escrib ed in the “A ction s in C om bat” section later in this chapter. M any class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. The “ M ovem ent and P osition ” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your m ove. You can forgo m oving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you c a n ’t d ecide what to do on your turn, con sider taking the D od g e or R eady action, as d escrib ed in “A ction s in C om bat.” B o n u s A c t i o n s Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bon u s action. The Cunning A ction feature, for exam ple, allow s a rogu e to take a bon u s action. You can take a bon u s action only w hen a sp ecia l ability, spell, or other feature o f the gam e states that you can do som eth in g as a bon u s action. You oth erw ise d on ’t have a bon u s action to take. You can take only on e bon u s action on your turn, so you must c h o o s e w hich bon u s action to u se w h en you have m ore than one available. You c h o o s e w hen to take a bon u s action during your turn, u nless the bon u s action ’s tim ing is specified, and anything that deprives you o f your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bon u s action. O t h e r A c t i v i t y o n Y o u r T u r n Y our turn can include a variety o f flou rish es that require neither your action n or your m ove. You ca n com m u n ica te how ever you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. You can also interact with on e object or feature o f the environm ent for free, during either your m ove or your action. For exam ple, you cou ld op en a d oor during your m ove as you stride tow ard a foe, or you cou ld draw your w eap on as part o f the sam e action you use to attack. If you w ant to interact with a se co n d object, you n eed to use your action. S o m e m agic item s and other sp ecial ob jects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. T h e DM m ight require you to use an action for any o f these activities w h en it n eed s sp ecia l care or w hen it presents an unusual obstacle. F or instance, the DM cou ld reason ably e xpect you to use an action to op en a stuck d oor or turn a cra n k to low er a draw bridge. R e a c t i o n s Certain sp ecial abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a sp ecia l action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant resp on se to a trigger o f som e kind, w hich ca n o c cu r on your turn or on som eon e e lse’s. The opportunity attack, d escribed later in this chapter, is the m ost co m m o n type o f reaction. W h en you take a reaction, you can ’t take another one until the start o f your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creatu re’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction. M o v e m e n t a n d Po s i t i o n In com bat, characters and m on sters are in constant m otion, often using m ovem ent and position to gain the upper hand. I n t e r a c t i n g w i t h O b j e c t s A r o u n d Y o u Here are a few examples o f the sorts o f thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action: • draw or sheathe a sword • open or close a door • withdraw a potion from your backpack • pick up a dropped axe • take a bauble from a table • remove a ring from your finger • stuff some food into your mouth • plant a banner in the ground • fish a few coins from your belt pouch • drink all the ale in a flagon • throw a lever or a switch • pull a torch from a sconce • take a book from a shelf you can reach • extinguish a small flame • don a mask • pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head • put your ear to a door • kick a small stone • turn a key in a lock • tap the floor with a 10-foot pole • hand an item to another character On your turn, you can m ove a distance up to your sp eed. You can use as m uch or as little o f your sp eed as you like on your turn, follow in g the rules here. Your m ovem ent can include jum ping, clim bing, and sw im m in g. T h ese different m od es o f m ovem ent can b e com b in ed with w alking, or they can constitute your entire m ove. H ow ever you ’re m oving, you deduct the distance o f each part o f your m ove from your sp eed until it is u sed up or until you are done m oving. The “S p ecia l Types o f M ovem ent’’ section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jum ping, clim bing, and sw im m in g. B r e a k i n g U p Y o u r M o v e You can break up your m ovem ent on your turn, using som e o f your sp eed before and after your action. For exam ple, if you have a sp eed o f 30 feet, you can m ove 10 feet, take your action, and then m ove 20 feet. M o v i n g b e t w e e n A t t a c k s If you take an action that in cludes m ore than one w eapon attack, you can break up your m ovem ent even further by m oving b etw een th ose attacks. For exam ple, a fighter w h o can m ake tw o attacks w ith the Extra Attack feature and w h o has a sp eed o f 25 feet cou ld m ove 10 feet, m ake an attack, m ove 15 feet, and then attack again. U s i n g D i f f e r e n t S p e e d s If you have m ore than one sp eed, such as your w alkin g sp eed and a flying sp eed, you can sw itch ba ck and forth b etw een your sp eed s during your m ove. W h en ever you switch, subtract the distance you've already m oved from the n ew speed. T h e result determ ines h ow m uch farther you can m ove. If the result is 0 or less, you ca n ’t use the n ew sp eed during the current m ove. For exam ple, if you have a sp eed o f 3 0 and a flying sp eed o f 60 b eca u se a w izard cast the fly spell on you, you cou ld fly 20 feet, then w alk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet m ore. D i f f i c u l t T e r r a i n Com bat rarely takes place in bare room s or on featureless plains. B ou lder-strew n caverns, briar- ch oked forests, treach erou s sta irca ses—the setting o f a typical fight contain s difficult terrain. Every foot o f m ovem ent in difficult terrain co sts 1 extra foot. T h is rule is true even if multiple things in a sp ace coun t as difficult terrain. L ow furniture, rubble, undergrow th, steep stairs, snow, and sh allow b o g s are exam ples o f difficult terrain. T h e sp ace o f another creature, w hether h ostile or not, also cou n ts as difficult terrain. B e i n g P r o n e Com batants often find them selves lying on the ground, either b eca u se they are k n ock ed dow n or b eca u se they th row th em selves dow n. In the gam e, they are prone, a condition d escrib ed in appendix A. You can drop prone w ithout u sing any o f your speed. Standing up takes m ore effort; doin g s o costs an am ount o f m ovem ent equal to h alf your sp eed. For exam ple, if y ou r sp eed is 30 feet, you must sp en d 15 feet o f m ovem ent to stand up. You ca n ’t stand up if you d on ’t have enough m ovem ent left or if your sp eed is 0. To m ove w hile prone, you must crawl or u se m agic such as teleportation. Every foot o f m ovem ent w hile craw ling co sts 1 extra foot. C raw ling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, co sts 3 feet o f m ovem ent. M o v i n g A r o u n d O t h e r C r e a t u r e s Y ou can m ove through a n on h ostile creatu re’s space. In contrast, you can m ove th rough a hostile creature's sp ace only if the creature is at least tw o sizes larger or sm aller than you. R em em ber that another creatu re’s sp ace is difficult terrain for you. W h eth er a creature is a friend or an enemy, you ca n ’t w illingly end your m ove in its space. If you leave a hostile creatu re’s reach during your m ove, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter. F l y i n g M o v e m e n t Flying creatures enjoy m any benefits o f mobility, but they m ust a lso deal w ith the danger o f falling. If a flying creature is k n ock ed prone, has its sp eed red u ced to 0, or is oth erw ise deprived o f the ability to m ove, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is b ein g held aloft by m agic, such as by the fly spell. C r e a t u r e S i z e E ach creature takes up a different am ount o f space. T h e S ize C ategories table sh ow s h ow m uch sp ace a creature o f a particular size con trols in com bat. O bjects som etim es use the sam e size categories. S i z e C a t e g o r i e sS i z e C a t e g o r i e s Size Space Tiny 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft Small 5 by 5 ft. Medium 5 by 5 ft. Large 10 by 10 ft. Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger S p a c e A creature's sp ace is the area in feet that it effectively con trols in com bat, not an expression o f its physical dim ension s. A typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet w ide, for exam ple, but it d o e s con trol a sp ace that w ide. If a M edium h obgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorw ay, other creatu res ca n ’t get through unless the h obgoblin lets them. A creatu re’s sp ace also reflects the area it n eeds to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the n um ber o f creatu res that can su rrou nd another creature in com bat. A ssu m in g M edium com batants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. B eca u se larger creatures take up m ore space, few er o f them can su rrou nd a creature. If five Large creatures V a r i a n t : P l a y i n g o n a G r i d If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules. Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet. Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed o f 30 feet translates into a speed o f 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet. Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square o f movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The D unge o n M a ste r’s Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.) If a square costs extra movement, as a square o f difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square o f difficult terrain. Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner o f a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space. Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares from a square adjacent to one o f them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route. crow d around a M edium or sm aller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as m any as twenty M edium creatu res ca n su rrou nd a Gargantuan one. S q u e e z i n g i n t o a S m a l l e r S p a c e A creature can sq u eeze through a sp ace that is large en ough for a creature one size sm aller than it. Thus, a L arge creature can sq u eeze through a pa ssa ge that's only 5 feet w ide. W h ile squeezing through a space, a creature m ust sp en d 1 extra foot for every foot it m oves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and D exterity saving throw s. A ttack rolls against the creature have advantage w hile it’s in the sm aller space. A c t i o n s i n C o m b a t W h en you take your action on your turn, you can take on e o f the actions presen ted here, an action you gained from your class or a sp ecia l feature, or an action that you im provise. M any m on sters have action options o f their ow n in their stat block s. W h en you d escrib e an action not detailed elsew h ere in the rules, the DM tells you w hether that action is possib le and what kind o f roll you n eed to m ake, if any, to determ ine s u c ce s s or failure. A t t a c k Th e m ost co m m o n action to take in com bat is the A ttack action, w hether you are sw in gin g a sw ord, firing an arrow from a bow , or braw ling w ith your fists. W ith this action, you m ake on e m elee or ranged attack. S e e the “M aking an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra A ttack feature o f the fighter, allow you to m ake m ore than on e attack with this action. C a s t a S p e l l S p ellcasters such as w izard s and clerics, as w ell as m any m onsters, have a c c e ss to sp ells and can use them to great effect in com bat. Each spell has a casting tim e, w hich sp ecifies w hether the caster m ust use an action, a reaction, m inutes, or even h ours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not n ecessarily an action. M ost spells do have a castin g tim e o f 1 action, s o a spellcaster often u ses his or her action in com bat to cast such a spell. S e e chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting. D a s h W h en you take the D ash action, you gain extra m ovem ent for the current turn. The in crease equals your speed, after applying any m odifiers. W ith a sp eed o f 30 feet, for example, you can m ove up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash. Any in crease or d ecrea se to your sp eed changes this additional m ovem ent by the sam e am ount. If your sp eed o f 30 feet is redu ced to 15 feet, for instance, you can m ove up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. D i s e n g a g e If you take the D isen gage action, your m ovem ent d oesn ’t provoke opportu nity attacks for the rest o f the turn. D o d g e W h en you take the D od ge action, you focu s entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start o f your next turn, any attack roll m ade against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you m ake D exterity saving th row s w ith advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your sp eed d rop s to 0. H e l p You can lend your aid to another creature in the com pletion o f a task. W h en you take the H elp action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability ch eck it m akes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it m akes the ch eck before the start o f your next turn. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature w ithin 5 feet o f you. You feint, distract the target, or in som e other w ay team up to m ake your ally’s attack m ore effective. If your ally attacks the target b efore your next turn, the first attack roll is m ade with advantage. H i d e W h en you take the H ide action, you m ake a Dexterity (Stealth) ch eck in an attempt to hide, follow in g the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you su cceed , you gain certain benefits, as d escrib ed in the “ U nseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter. M a k i n g a n A t t a c k Im p r o v i s i n g a n A c t i o n Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions o f the ability scores in chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind o f roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure. R e a d y S e a r c h W h en you take the S ea rch action, you devote your attention to finding som ething. D epen d in g on the nature o f your search, the DM m ight have you m ake a W isd om (P erception ) ch eck o r an Intelligence (Investigation) check. U s e a n O b j e c t You n orm ally interact w ith an object w hile doin g som eth in g else, such as w hen you draw a sw ord as part o f an attack. W h en an ob ject requ ires your action for its use, you take the U se an O bject action. T h is action is also useful w hen you w ant to interact w ith m ore than on e object on your turn. W h eth er you ’re striking w ith a m elee w eapon , firing a w ea p on at range, or m akin g an attack roll as part o f a spell, an attack has a sim ple structure. S om etim es you w ant to get the ju m p on a foe or wait for a particular circu m stan ce before you act. To do so, you can take the R eady action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction. First, you decide w hat perceivable circu m stan ce w ill trigger your reaction. Then, you c h o o s e the action you w ill take in resp on se to that trigger, or you c h o o s e to m ove up to your sp eed in resp on se to it. E xam ples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that op en s it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I m ove away.” W h en the trigger occu rs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. R em em ber that you can take only one reaction p er round. W h en you ready a spell, you cast it as norm al but hold its energy, w h ich you release w ith your reaction w hen the trigger occu rs. To be readied, a spell must have a castin g tim e o f 1 action, and h olding onto the sp ell’s m agic requ ires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates w ithout taking effect. For exam ple, if you are concentratin g on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take dam age before you release magic missile w ith your reaction, your concentration m ight be broken. A t t a c k R o l l s W h en you m ake an attack, your attack roll determ ines w hether the attack hits or m isses. To m ake an attack roll, roll a d2 0 and add the appropriate m odifiers. If the total o f the roll plus m odifiers equals or e x ceed s the target’s A rm or C lass (AC), the attack hits. The AC o f a character is determ ined at character creation, w h ereas the AC o f a m onster is in its stat block. M o d i f i e r s t o t h e R o l l W h en a character m akes an attack roll, the tw o m ost com m on m odifiers to the roll are an ability m odifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. W h en a m onster m akes an attack roll, it u ses w hatever m odifier is provided in its stat block. A bility M odifier. T h e ability m odifier u sed for a m elee w eapon attack is Strength, and the ability m odifier used for a ranged w eap on attack is Dexterity. W ea pon s that have the fin esse or throw n property break this rule. S o m e sp ells also require an attack roll. The ability m odifier u sed for a spell attack depen ds on the sp ellcastin g ability o f the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10. P roficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bon u s to your attack roll w hen you attack using a w eap on with w hich you have proficiency, as w ell as w hen you attack with a spell. R o l l i n g 1 o r 2 0 S om etim es fate b le ss e s or cu rses a com batant, causing the n ovice to hit and the veteran to m iss. If the d 2 0 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless o f any m odifiers or the target’s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter. If the d2 0 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack m isses regardless o f any m odifiers or the target’s AC. U n s e e n A t t a c k e r s a n d T a r g e t s 1. Choose a target. P ick a target w ithin y ou r attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location. 2. Determine modifiers. T h e DM determ ines w hether the target has cover and w hether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, sp ecia l abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or b on u ses to your attack roll. 3. Resolve the attack. You m ake the attack roll. On a hit, you roll dam age, unless the particular attack has rules that sp ecify otherw ise. S o m e attacks cau se sp ecia l effects in addition to or instead o f dam age. If th ere’s ever any question w hether som eth in g y ou ’re doin g coun ts as an attack, the rule is sim ple: if you ’re m akin g an attack roll, you ’re m aking an attack. C om batants often try to esca p e their fo e s ’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. W h en you attack a target that you ca n ’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true w hether you ’re gu essin g the target’s location or you ’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you autom atically m iss, but the D M typically ju st says that the attack m issed, not w hether you g u essed the target’s location correctly. W h en a creature ca n ’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are h idden—both u n seen and u nheard—w hen you m ake an attack, you give away your location w hen the attack hits or m isses. R a n g e d A t t a c k s W h en you m ake a ranged attack, you fire a b o w or a crossb ow , hurl a handaxe, or oth erw ise sen d projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A m onster might shoot spines from its tail. M any sp ells also involve m akin g a ranged attack. R a n g e You can m ake ranged attacks only against targets w ithin a sp ecified range. If a ranged attack, such as one m ade w ith a spell, has a single range, you ca n ’t attack a target beyond this range. S o m e ranged attacks, such as th ose m ade w ith a lon g b ow o r a shortbow , have tw o ranges. The sm aller num ber is the n orm al range, and the larger n um ber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage w hen your target is beyon d n orm al range, and you ca n ’t attack a target beyon d the long range. R a n g e d A t t a c k s i n C l o s e C o m b a t A im in g a ranged attack is m ore difficult w h en a foe is next to you. W h en you m ake a ranged attack with a w eapon , a spell, or som e other m eans, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are w ithin 5 feet o f a h ostile creature w h o can see you and w h o isn’t incapacitated. M e l e e A t t a c k s U sed in hand-to-hand com bat, a m elee attack allow s you to attack a foe w ithin your reach. A m elee attack typically u ses a handheld w eap on such as a sw ord, a w arham m er, or an axe. A typical m onster m akes a m elee attack w h en it strikes w ith its claw s, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other b od y part. A few sp ells also involve m akin g a m elee attack. M ost creatu res have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets w ithin 5 feet o f them w hen m akin g a m elee attack. Certain creatu res (typically th ose larger than M edium ) have m elee attacks w ith a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. W h en you are unarmed, you can fight in m elee by m akin g an u narm ed strike, as sh ow n in the w eap on table in chapter 5. O p p o r t u n i t y A t t a c k s In a fight, everyone is constantly w atching for en em ies to drop their guard. You can rarely m ove h eedlessly past your fo e s w ithout putting y ou rself in danger; doin g so provokes an opportunity attack. You can m ake an opportunity attack w hen a hostile creature that you can see m oves out o f your reach. To m ake the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to m ake on e m elee attack against the provoking C o n t e s t s i n C o m b a t Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM can use these contests as models for improvising others. creature. T h e attack interrupts the provokin g creatu re’s m ovem ent, o ccu rrin g right before the creature leaves your reach. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the D isen gage action. You also d on ’t provoke an opportu nity attack w hen you teleport or w hen som eon e or som eth in g m oves you w ithout using your m ovem ent, action, or reaction. For exam ple, you don ’t provoke an opportu nity attack if an explosion hurls you out o f a fo e ’s reach or if gravity cau ses you to fall past an enemy. Two- W e a p o n F i g h t i n g W h en you take the A ttack action and attack w ith a light m elee w eap on that you ’re h olding in on e hand, you can u se a bon u s action to attack w ith a different light m elee w eap on that you ’re h olding in the other hand. You d on ’t add your ability m odifier to the dam age o f the bon u s attack, u nless that m odifier is negative. If either w eap on has the throw n property, you can th row the w eapon , instead o f m akin g a m elee attack w ith it. G r a p p l i n g W h en you w ant to grab a creature or w restle w ith it, you can u se the Attack action to m ake a sp ecia l m elee attack, a grapple. If you ’re able to m ake multiple attacks w ith the A ttack action, this attack rep laces on e o f them. T h e target o f your grapple must be no m ore than one size larger than you, and it must be w ithin your reach. U sing at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by m ak in g a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) ch eck contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or D exterity (A crobatics) ch eck (the target c h o o s e s the ability to use). If you s u cceed , you su bject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition sp ecifies the things that end it, and you can release the target w henever you like (no action required). Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can u se its action to escap e. To do so, it must su cce e d on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (A crobatics) ch eck contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. Moving a Grappled Creature. W h en you m ove, you can drag or carry the grappled creature w ith you, but your sp eed is halved, u nless the creature is tw o or m ore sizes sm aller than you. S h o v i n g a C r e a t u r e U sing the A ttack action, you can m ake a sp ecia l m elee attack to shove a creature, either to k n ock it prone or push it away from you. If you ’re able to m ake multiple attacks w ith the A ttack action, this attack replaces one o f them. The target o f your shove m ust be no m ore than one size larger than you, and it m ust be w ithin your reach. You m ake a Stren gth (Athletics) ch eck contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or D exterity (A crobatics) ch eck (the target c h o o s e s the ability to use). If you w in the contest, you either kn ock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you. C o v e r W alls, trees, creatures, and other obsta cles can provide cover during com bat, m aking a target m ore difficult to harm . A target can benefit from cover only w hen an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side o f the cover. There are three deg rees o f cover. If a target is behind multiple s o u rce s o f cover, only the m ost protective degree o f cover applies; the deg rees aren't added together. For exam ple, if a target is behind a creature that gives h alf cover and a tree trunk that gives three- quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. A target w ith half cover has a +2 bon u s to AC and D exterity saving throw s. A target has h alf cover if an obstacle block s at least h alf o f its body. The obstacle might b e a low w all, a large p iece o f furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, w hether that creature is an enem y or a friend. A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and D exterity saving throw s. A target has three- quarters cover if about three-quarters o f it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle m ight b e a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total cover ca n ’t b e targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although som e spells can reach such a target by including it in an area o f effect. A target has total cover if it is com pletely con cea led by an obstacle. D a m a g e a n d H e a l i n g Injury and the risk o f death are constant com p a n ion s o f th ose w h o explore the w orld s o f D&D. T h e thrust o f a sw ord, a w ell-placed arrow, or a blast o f flam e from a fireball spell all have the potential to dam age, or even kill, the hardiest o f creatures. H i t P o i n t s Hit points represent a com bination o f physical and mental durability, the w ill to live, and luck. Creatures w ith m ore hit points are m ore difficult to kill. T h ose w ith few er hit points are m ore fragile. A creatu re’s current hit points (usually ju st called hit points) can be any n um ber from the creatu re’s hit point m axim u m dow n to 0. This n um ber changes frequently as a creature takes dam age or receives healing. W h enever a creature takes dam age, that dam age is subtracted from its hit points. The loss o f hit points has n o effect on a creatu re’s capabilities until the creature d rops to 0 hit points. D a m a g e R o l l s E ach w eapon , spell, and harm ful m onster ability sp ecifies the dam age it deals. You roll the dam age die or dice, add any m odifiers, and apply the dam age to your target. M agic w eapon s, sp ecial abilities, and other factors can grant a bon u s to dam age. W h en attacking w ith a weapon, you add your ability m odifier—the sam e m odifier u sed for the attack roll— to the dam age. A spell tells you w hich d ice to roll for dam age and w hether to add any m odifiers. If a spell or other effect deals dam age to more than one target at the sa m e time, roll the dam age on ce for all o f them. For exam ple, w hen a w izard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the sp ell’s dam age is rolled o n ce for all creatu res caught in the blast. C r i t i c a l H i t s W h en you sco re a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s dam age against the target. R oll all o f the attack’s dam age d ice tw ice and add them together. Then add any relevant m odifiers as norm al. To sp eed up play, you can roll all the dam age d ice at once. For exam ple, if you sco re a critical hit w ith a dagger, roll 2d4 for the dam age, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other dam age dice, such as from the rogu e’s S n ea k Attack feature, you roll th ose dice tw ice as w ell. D a m a g e T y p e s Different attacks, dam aging spells, and other harm ful effects deal different types o f dam age. D am age types have no rules o f their ow n, but other rules, such as dam age resistance, rely on the types. The dam age types follow, w ith exam ples to help a DM assign a dam age type to a new effect. Acid. T h e corrosiv e spray o f a black dragon ’s breath and the dissolvin g en zym es secreted by a black pudding deal acid dam age. Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—ham m ers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeon ing dam age. Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast o f a w hite dragon ’s breath deal cold dam age. Fire. R ed dragons breathe fire, and m any spells conjure flam es to deal fire dam age. Force. F orce is pure m agical en ergy focu sed into a dam agin g form . M ost effects that deal force dam age are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon ’s breath deal lightning dam age. Necrotic. N ecrotic dam age, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, w ithers matter and even the soul. Piercing. P unctu ring and im paling attacks, including sp ears and m on sters’ bites, deal piercing dam age. Poison. V en om ou s stings and the toxic gas o f a green dragon ’s breath deal p oison dam age. Psychic. M ental abilities such as a m ind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic dam age. Radiant. Radiant dam age, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s sm iting w eapon , sea rs the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit w ith pow er. Slashing. S w ord s, axes, and m on sters’ claw s deal slashing dam age. Thunder. A con cu ssive burst o f sound, such as the effect o f the thunderwave spell, deals thunder dam age. D a m a g e R e s i s t a n c e a n d V u l n e r a b i l i t y S o m e creatures and ob jects are exceedin gly difficult or unusually easy to hurt w ith certain types o f dam age. If a creature or an object has resistance to a dam age type, dam age o f that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a dam age type, dam age o f that type is dou bled against it. R esistan ce and then vulnerability are applied after all other m od ifiers to dam age. For exam ple, a creature has resistan ce to bludgeon ing dam age and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeon ing dam age. The creature is a lso w ithin a m agical aura that red u ces all dam age by 5. T h e 25 dam age is first redu ced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 dam age. Multiple in stan ces o f resistan ce or vulnerability that affect the sa m e dam age type count as only on e instance. F or exam ple, if a creature has resistan ce to fire dam age as w ell as resistan ce to all n onm agical dam age, the dam age o f a n onm agical fire is redu ced by h alf against the creature, not redu ced by three-quarters. H e a l i n g U n less it results in death, dam age isn’t perm anent. Even death is reversible through p ow erfu l m agic. R est can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 8), and m agical m ethods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion o f healing can rem ove dam age in an instant. W h en a creature receives healing o f any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creatu re’s hit points ca n ’t ex ceed its hit point m axim um , so any hit points regained in ex ce s s o f this num ber are lost. For exam ple, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger h as 14 current hit points and has a hit point m axim u m o f 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. A creature that has died ca n ’t regain hit points until m agic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life. D r o p p i n g t o 0 H i t P o i n t s W h en you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall u n con sciou s, as explained in the follow in g sections. I n s t a n t D e a t h M assive dam age ca n kill you instantly. W h en dam age redu ces you to 0 hit points and there is dam age rem aining, you die if the rem aining dam age equals or ex ce e d s your hit point m axim um . F or exam ple, a cleric w ith a m a xim u m o f 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 dam age from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 dam age rem ains. B ecau se the rem aining dam age equals her hit point m axim um , the cleric dies. Fa l l i n g U n c o n s c i o u s If dam age red u ces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall u n con sciou s (see appendix A). This u n con sciou sn ess ends if you regain any hit points. D e s c r i b i n g t h e E f f e c t s o f D a m a g e Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more o f your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs o f wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious. D e a t h S a v i n g T h r o w s W h enever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must m ake a sp ecia l saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determ ine w hether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throw s, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands o f fate now, aided only by spells and features that im prove your ch a n ces o f su cceed in g on a saving throw. R oll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you su cceed . O therw ise, you fail. A s u c ce s s or failure has no effect by itself. On your third su ccess, you b e co m e stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The su c ce s se s and failures don't need to be consecu tive; keep track o f both until you collect three o f a kind. The num ber o f both is reset to zero w hen you regain any hit points or b e co m e stable. Rolling 1 or 20. W h en you m ake a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it coun ts as tw o failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any dam age w hile you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the dam age is from a critical hit, you suffer tw o failures instead. If the dam age equals or ex ceed s your hit point m axim um , you suffer instant death. St a b i l i z i n g a C r e a t u r e T h e best w ay to save a creature w ith 0 hit poin ts is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw. You can u se your action to adm inister first aid to an u n con sciou s creature and attempt to stabilize it, w hich requ ires a su ccessfu l D C 10 W isd om (M edicine) check. A stable creature d oesn ’t m ake death saving throw s, even though it has 0 hit points, but it d o e s rem ain u n con sciou s. The creature stops being stable, and must start m aking death saving throw s again, if it takes any dam age. A stable creature that isn’t h ealed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. M o n s t e r s a n d D e a t h M ost D M s have a m onster die the instant it d rops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall u n con sciou s and m ake death saving throw s. M ighty villains and sp ecia l nonplayer characters are com m on exception s; the DM m ight have them fall u n con sciou s and follow the sam e rules as player characters. K n o c k i n g a C r e a t u r e O u t S om etim es an attacker w ants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. W h en an attacker redu ces a creature to 0 hit points with a m elee attack, the attacker can k n ock the creature out. T h e attacker can m ake this ch oice the instant the dam age is dealt. T h e creature falls u n con sciou s and is stable. T e m p o r a r y H i t P o i n t s S o m e sp ells and sp ecial abilities con fer tem porary hit points to a creature. T em porary hit p oints aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against dam age, a p o o l o f hit points that protect you from injury. W h en you have tem porary hit points and take dam age, the tem porary hit points are lost first, and any leftover d am age carries over to your norm al hit points. For exam ple, if you have 5 tem porary hit poin ts and take 7 dam age, you lose the tem porary hit points and then take 2 dam age. B eca u se tem porary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can ex ceed your hit point m axim um . A character can, therefore, be at full hit poin ts and receive tem porary hit points. H ealing ca n ’t restore tem porary hit points, and they ca n ’t b e added together. If you have tem porary hit points and receive m ore o f them , you d ecide w hether to keep the on es you have or to gain the n ew ones. For exam ple, if a spell grants you 12 tem porary hit points w hen you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. If you have 0 hit points, receivin g tem porary hit points d oesn ’t restore you to con s cio u s n e s s or stabilize you. T h ey can still absorb dam age directed at you w hile you ’re in that state, but only true h ealing can save you. U nless a feature that grants you tem porary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a lon g rest. M o u n t e d C o m b a t A knight chargin g into battle on a w arhorse, a w izard casting sp ells from the back o f a griffon, or a cleric soa rin g through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits o f sp eed and m obility that a m ount can provide. A w illing creature that is at least on e size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatom y can serve as a m ount, u sing the follow in g rules. M o u n t i n g a n d D i s m o u n t i n g O nce during your m ove, you ca n m ount a creature that is w ithin 5 feet o f you or dism ount. D oin g s o co sts an am ount o f m ovem ent equal to h alf your sp eed. For exam ple, if your sp eed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet o f m ovem ent to m ount a horse. Th erefore, you ca n ’t m ount it if you d on ’t have 15 feet o f m ovem ent left or if your sp eed is 0. If an effect m oves your m ount against its w ill w hile you ’re on it, you m ust su cce e d on a D C 10 Dexterity saving th row or fall o ff the m ount, landing prone in a sp ace w ithin 5 feet o f it. If you ’re k n ock ed prone w hile m ounted, you must m ake the sam e saving throw. If your m ount is k n ock ed prone, you can u se your reaction to dism ount it as it falls and land on your feet. O therw ise, you are dism ounted and fall prone in a sp ace w ithin 5 feet it. C o n t r o l l i n g a M o u n t W h ile you're m ounted, you have tw o options. You can either control the m ount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a m ount only if it has been trained to a ccept a rider. D om esticated h orses, donkeys, and sim ilar creatures are a ssu m ed to have such training. T h e initiative o f a controlled m ount changes to match y ou rs w hen you m ount it. It m oves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, D isengage, and D odge. A con trolled m ount can m ove and act even on the turn that you m ount it. An independent m ount retains its place in the initiative order. B earin g a rider puts no restriction s on the actions the m ount can take, and it m oves and acts as it w ish es. It might flee from com bat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or oth erw ise act against your w ish es. In either case, if the m ount provokes an opportunity attack w hile y ou ’re on it, the attacker can target you or the m ount. U n d e r w a t e r C o m b a t W h en adventurers pursue sahuagin ba ck to their undersea hom es, fight o ff sharks in an ancient sh ipw reck, or find th em selves in a flood ed dungeon room , they must fight in a challen ging environm ent. U nderw ater the follow in g rules apply. W h en m akin g a melee weapon attack, a creature that d oesn ’t have a sw im m in g sp eed (either natural or granted by m agic) has disadvantage on the attack roll u nless the w eap on is a dagger, javelin, sh ortsw ord, spear, or trident. A ranged weapon attack autom atically m isses a target beyon d the w ea p on ’s n orm al range. Even against a target w ithin norm al range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the w eap on is a crossbow , a net, or a w eap on that is throw n like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). Creatures and objects that are fully im m ersed in w ater have resistan ce to fire dam age. C h a p t e r 10: S p e l l c a s t i n g MAGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND m ost often appears in the form o f a spell. Th is chapter provides the rules for casting spells. D ifferent character cla sses have distinctive w ays o f learning and preparin g their spells, and m onsters use sp ells in unique w ays. R eg ardless o f its sou rce, a spell follow s the rules here. W h a t I s a Sp e l l ? A spell is a discrete m agical effect, a single shaping o f the m agical energies that suffuse the m ultiverse into a specific, lim ited expression . In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw m agic suffusing the w orld, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a sp ecific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in m ost cases, all in the span o f secon d s. S p ells can b e versatile tools, w eapon s, or protective w ards. Th ey can deal dam age or undo it, im p ose or rem ove condition s (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead. U ncounted th ou san ds o f spells have been created over the cou rse o f the m ultiverse’s history, and m any o f them are long forgotten. S o m e m ight yet lie record ed in cru m blin g sp ellb ook s hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the m inds o f dead gods. O r they m ight som eday be reinvented by a character w h o has am assed enough pow er and w isd om to d o so. S p e l l L e v e l Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A sp ell’s level is a general indicator o f h ow p ow erfu l it is, w ith the low ly (but still im pressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—sim ple but pow erfu l sp ells that characters can cast alm ost by rote— are level 0. T h e h igher a sp ell’s level, the higher level a sp ellcaster m ust be to u se that spell. S p ell level and character level d on ’t corresp on d directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell. K n o w n a n d P r e p a r e d S p e l l s B efore a spellcaster can u se a spell, he or she must have the spell firm ly fixed in m ind, or m ust have a cce ss to the spell in a m agic item. M em bers o f a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a lim ited list o f sp ells they k n ow that are always fixed in m ind. The sam e thing is true o f m any m agic-using m onsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and w izards, u ndergo a p r o ce s s o f preparin g spells. T h is p r o ce s s varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions. C a s t i n g i n A r m o r Because o f the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting. In every case, the num ber o f sp ells a caster can have fixed in m ind at any given tim e depen ds on the character’s level. S p e l l S l o t s R egardless o f h ow m any sp ells a caster k n ow s or prepares, he or she can cast only a lim ited num ber o f spells before resting. M anipulating the fabric o f m agic and chann elin g its energy into even a sim ple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even m ore so. Thus, each sp ellcastin g cla ss’s description (except that o f the w arlock) includes a table sh ow in g h ow m any spell slots o f each spell level a character can u se at each character level. For exam ple, the 3rd-level w izard Um ara has four 1st-level spell slots and tw o 2nd-level slots. W h en a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot o f that sp ell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot w ith the spell. You can think o f a spell slot as a g roove o f a certain size—sm all for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell o f higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot o f any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. S o w hen Um ara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she sp en ds on e o f her four 1st-level slots and has three rem aining. Finishing a lon g rest restores any expended spell slots (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting). S o m e characters and m on sters have sp ecia l abilities that let them cast spells w ithout using spell slots. For exam ple, a m on k w ho follow s the W ay o f the Four Elem ents, a w arlock w ho c h o o s e s certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine H ells can all cast spells in such a way. C a s t i n g a S p e l l a t a H i g h e r L e v e l W h en a sp ellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is o f a higher level than the spell, the spell a ssu m es the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Um ara casts magic missile u sing on e o f her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into. S o m e spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have m ore pow erfu l effects w hen cast at a higher level, as detailed in a sp ell’s description. C a n t r i p s A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, w ithout using a spell slot and w ithout being prepared in advance. R epeated practice h as fixed the spell in the caster’s m ind and in fused the caster w ith the m agic n eeded to produ ce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0. R i t u a l s Certain spells have a sp ecia l tag: ritual. S u ch a spell can be cast follow in g the n orm al rules for spellcasting, or the spell can b e cast as a ritual. T h e ritual version o f a spell takes 10 m inutes longer to cast than norm al. It also d oesn ’t expend a spell slot, w hich m ea n s the ritual version o f a spell ca n ’t be cast at a higher level. To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster m ust have a feature that grants the ability to do so. T h e cleric and the druid, for exam ple, have such a feature. T h e caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list o f spells know n, u nless the character’s ritual feature sp ecifies oth erw ise, as the w iza rd ’s does. C a s t i n g a Sp e l l W h en a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules are follow ed, regardless o f the character’s class or the sp ell’s effects. Each spell description in chapter 11 begin s with a block o f inform ation, including the spell’s name, level, sch ool o f m agic, casting time, range, com ponents, and duration. T he rest o f a spell entry d escribes the spell’s effect. C a s t i n g T i m e M ost spells require a single action to cast, but som e sp ells require a bon u s action, a reaction, or m uch m ore tim e to cast. B o n u s A c t i o n A spell cast with a bon u s action is esp ecia lly swift. You m ust use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bon u s action this turn. You ca n ’t cast another spell during the sam e turn, except for a cantrip with a casting tim e o f 1 action. R e a c t i o n s S o m e sp ells can be cast as reactions. T h ese spells take a fraction o f a se co n d to bring about and are cast in resp on se to som e event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly w hen you can do so. L o n g e r C a s t i n g T i m e s Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require m ore time to cast: m inutes or even hours. W h en you cast a spell w ith a castin g tim e longer than a single action or reaction, you m ust sp en d your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration w hile you do s o (see “C oncentration” below ). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don ’t expend a spell slot. If you w ant to try castin g the spell again, you m ust start over. R a n g e The target o f a spell m ust be w ithin the sp ell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. F or a spell like fireball, the target is the point in sp ace w here the ball o f fire erupts. M ost sp ells have ran ges ex p ressed in feet. S om e sp ells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. T h ese spells have a range o f self. S p ells that create co n e s or lin es o f effect that originate from you also have a range o f self, indicating that the origin point o f the sp ell’s effect must be you (see “A reas o f E ffect” later in the this chapter). O nce a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise. C o m p o n e n t s A sp ell’s com pon en ts are the physical requirem ents you m ust m eet in order to cast it. E ach spell’s description indicates w hether it requ ires verbal (V), som atic (S), or m aterial (M ) com pon en ts. If you ca n ’t provide one or m ore o f a sp ell’s com pon en ts, you are unable to cast the spell. V e r b a l ( V ) M ost spells require the chanting o f m ystic w ords. The w ord s them selves aren’t the so u rce o f the sp ell’s pow er; rather, the particular com bination o f sou n ds, with sp ecific pitch and reson an ce, sets the threads o f m agic in m otion. Thus, a character w h o is gagged or in an area o f silence, such as on e created by the silence spell, ca n ’t cast a spell w ith a verbal com ponent. S o m a t i c (S ) Spellcasting gestures m ight include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set o f gestures. If a spell requ ires a som atic com pon ent, the caster must have free use o f at least one hand to perform these gestures. M a t e r i a l ( M ) Casting so m e spells requ ires particular objects, sp ecified in paren th eses in the com p on en t entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place o f the com p on en ts sp ecified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a com pon ent, a character m ust have that sp ecific com pon en t before he or sh e can cast the spell. If a spell states that a material com p on en t is con su m ed by the spell, the caster m ust provide this com p on en t for each castin g o f the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to a c c e s s these com pon en ts, but it can be the sam e hand that he or she u ses to p erform som atic com pon ents. D u r a t i o n A spell's duration is the length o f tim e the spell persists. A duration can be ex p ressed in rounds, m inutes, hours, or even years. S o m e spells sp ecify that their effects last until the sp ells are dispelled or destroyed. I n s t a n t a n e o u s M any spells are instantaneous. T h e spell harm s, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an ob ject in a w ay that ca n ’t b e dispelled, b eca u se its m agic exists only for an instant. C o n c e n t r a t i o n S o m e spells require you to m aintain concentration in order to keep their m a gic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell m ust be m aintained w ith concentration, that fact appears in its D uration entry, and the spell sp ecifies h ow lon g you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any tim e (no action required). T h e S c h o o l s o f M a g i c Academies o f magic group spells into eight categories called schools o f magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some o f them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes o f existence. Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out o f nothing. Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses o f the future, the locations o f hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. Enchantment spells affect the minds o f others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts o f fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds. Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds o f others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind o f a creature. Necromancy spells manipulate the energies o f life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve o f life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently. Transmutation spells change the properties o f a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength o f an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. N orm al activity, such as m ovin g and attacking, d oesn ’t interfere w ith concentration. The follow in g factors can break concentration: • Casting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requ ires concentration. You ca n ’t c o n c e n ­ trate on tw o sp ells at once. • Taking damage. W h enever you take dam age w hile you are concentratin g on a spell, you must m ake a Constitution saving th row to m aintain your con cen tra­ tion. T h e D C equals 10 or h alf the dam age you take, w hichever num ber is higher. If you take dam age from multiple sou rces, such as an arrow and a dragon ’s breath, you m ake a separate saving th row for each sou rce o f dam age. • Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a sp ell if you are incapacitated or if you die. Th e DM m ight also decide that certain environm ental phenom ena, such as a wave crash in g over you w hile y ou ’re on a storm -tossed ship, require you to su cceed on a D C 10 Constitution saving th row to maintain concentration on a spell. T a r g e t s A typical spell requires you to pick one or m ore targets to be affected by the sp ell’s m agic. A spell's description tells you w hether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point o f origin for an area o f effect (described below). U n less a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not k n ow it w as targeted by a spell at all. A n effect like cracklin g lightning is obvious, but a m ore subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creatu re’s thoughts, typically g oes u nnoticed, u nless a spell says otherw ise. A C l e a r Pa t h t o t h e T a r g e t To target som ething, you m ust have a clear path to it, so it ca n ’t be beh in d total cover. If you place an area o f effect at a point that you ca n ’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is betw een you and that point, the point o f origin co m e s into being on the near side o f that obstruction. T a r g e t i n g Y o u r s e l f If a sp ell targets a creature o f your ch oice, you can c h o o s e yourself, unless the creature must be h ostile or sp ecifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area o f effect o f a spell you cast, you can target yourself. A r e a s o f E f f e c t S p ells such as burning hands and cone o f cold cover an area, allow ing them to affect m ultiple creatu res at on ce. A sp ell’s description sp ecifies its area o f effect, w hich typically has on e o f five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area o f effect has a point o f origin, a location from w hich the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape sp ecify h ow you position its point o f origin. Typically, a point o f origin is a point in sp ace, but som e sp ells have an area w h ose origin is a creature or an object. A sp ell’s effect expands in straight lin es from the point o f origin. If n o u nblock ed straight line extends from the point o f origin to a location w ithin the area o f effect, that location isn’t included in the sp ell’s area. To block one o f these im aginary lines, an obstruction m ust provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9. C o n e A c on e extends in a direction you c h o o s e from its point o f origin. A c o n e ’s w idth at a given point along its length is equal to that poin t’s distance from the point o f origin. A c o n e ’s area o f effect sp ecifies its m axim u m length. A c o n e ’s point o f origin is not included in the c o n e ’s area o f effect, unless you d ecide otherw ise. C u b e You select a cu b e’s point o f origin, w hich lies anyw here on a face o f the cubic effect. T h e cu b e ’s size is ex p ressed as the length o f each side. A c u b e ’s point o f origin is not included in the cu b e ’s area o f effect, unless you d ecide otherw ise. C y l i n d e r A cylinder’s point o f origin is the center o f a circle o f a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle m ust either b e on the grou nd or at the height o f the spell effect. The en ergy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point o f origin to the perim eter o f the circle, form in g the ba se o f the cylinder. The sp ell’s effect then sh oots up from the ba se or dow n from the top, to a distance equal to the height o f the cylinder. A cylinder’s point o f origin is included in the cylinder’s area o f effect. L i n e A line extends from its point o f origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A lin e’s point o f origin is not included in the line’s area o f effect, u n less you d ecide otherw ise. S p h e r e You select a sp here’s point o f origin, and the sphere extends outw ard from that point. T h e sp here’s size is ex pressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A sp h ere’s point o f origin is included in the sp h ere’s area o f effect. S a v i n g T h r o w s Many spells sp ecify that a target can m ake a saving th row to avoid som e or all o f a sp ell’s effects. The spell sp ecifies the ability that the target u ses for the save and w hat happens on a s u c ce s s or failure. T h e D C to resist on e o f your sp ells equals 8 + your spellcastin g ability m odifier + your proficiency bon u s + any sp ecia l m odifiers. A t t a c k R o l l s S o m e spells require the caster to m ake an attack roll to determ ine w hether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bon u s w ith a spell attack equals your spellcastin g ability m odifier + your proficiency bonus. M ost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. R em em ber that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are w ithin 5 feet o f a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see chapter 9). C o m b i n i n g M a g i c a l E f f e c t s The effects o f different spells add together w hile the durations o f th ose sp ells overlap. The effects o f the sam e spell cast multiple tim es don't com bine, however. Instead, the m ost potent effect—such as the highest bon u s—from th ose castin gs applies w hile their durations overlap. For exam ple, if tw o clerics cast bless on the sam e target, that character gains the sp ell’s benefit only on ce; he or she d oesn ’t get to roll tw o bon u s dice. T h e W e a v e o f M a g i c The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will o f existence, permeating every bit o f matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse. Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use o f a fabric o f magic, a kind o f interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff o f raw magic. The spellcasters o f the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways o f naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds o f miles in the blink o f an eye, or even reverse death itself. All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds o f magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells o f wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane magic. These spells rely on an understanding— learned or intuitive— o f the workings o f the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands o f the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells o f clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave is mediated by divine power— gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight o f a paladin’s oath. Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads o f the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways— or not at all.

T h e area o f another spell or m agical effect, su ch as fireball, ca n ’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area o f m agic, the part o f the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

T h e principal difference is the addition o f a silvery cord that extends from b etw een your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot.

If you enter a n ew plane or return to the plane you w ere on w hen casting this spell, your b od y and possession s are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your b od y as you enter the n ew plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any dam age or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist w hen you return to it. The spell ends for you and your com p a n ion s w hen you use your action to dism iss it. W h en the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell m ight also end early for you or on e o f your com pan ion s. A su ccessfu l dispel magic spell u sed against an astral or physical b od y ends the spell for that creature. If a creatu re’s original b od y or its astral form d rops to 0 hit points, the spell en ds for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the co rd pulls the creatu re’s astral form ba ck to its body, ending its state o f su sp en ded anim ation. If you are returned to your b od y prematurely, your com p a n ion s rem ain in their astral form s and m ust find their ow n w ay ba ck to their b od ies, usually by droppin g to 0 hit points.

You d ecide the creatu re’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any o f the equipm ent created by the spell vanishes in a puff o f sm oke if it is carried m ore than 10 feet away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you c h o o s e can ride the steed. T h e creature u ses the statistics for a riding h orse, except it has a sp eed o f 100 feet and can travel 10 m iles in an hour, or 13 m iles at a fast pace. W h en the sp ell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 m inute to dism ount. T h e spell ends if you use an action to d ism iss it or if the steed takes any dam age. P l a n a r A l l y 6th-level conjuration Casting Tim e: 10 m inutes Range: 6 0 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous You b e s e e ch an otherw orldly entity for aid. T h e being must be kn ow n to you: a god, a prim ordial, a dem on prince, or som e other being o f co sm ic pow er. That entity sen ds a celestial, an elem ental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, m aking the creature appear in an u n occu pied sp ace w ithin range. If you k n ow a sp ecific creatu re’s nam e, you can sp eak that nam e w hen you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (D M ’s choice). W h en the creature appears, it is under no com pu lsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to p erform a serv ice in exch an ge for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task cou ld range from sim ple (fly us a cross the chasm , or help us fight a battle) to com p lex (spy on our en em ies, or protect us during ou r foray into the dungeon). You must be able to com m u n icate w ith the creature to bargain for its services. Paym ent can take a variety o f form s. A celestial might requ ire a sizable donation o f gold or m agic item s to an allied tem ple, w hile a fiend m ight dem and a living sacrifice or a gift o f treasure. S o m e creatures might exch an ge their serv ice for a quest undertaken by you. A s a rule o f thumb, a task that can be m easu red in m inutes requ ires a paym ent w orth 100 gp per minute. A task m easu red in hours requ ires 1,0 00 gp per hour. And a task m easu red in days (up to 10 days) requ ires 10,000 gp per day. T h e DM can adjust th ese paym ents ba sed on the circu m stan ces under w hich you cast the spell. If the task is aligned w ith the creatu re’s ethos, the payment m ight be halved or even w aived. N on h azardou s tasks typically require only h alf the su ggested payment, w hile esp ecia lly dangerou s tasks might require a greater gift. C reatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. A fter the creature com pletes the task, or w hen the agreed-upon duration o f serv ice expires, the creature returns to its h om e plane after reportin g ba ck to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creatu re’s service, the creature im m ediately returns to its h om e plane. A creature enlisted to join your group coun ts as a m em ber o f it, receivin g a full sh are o f experien ce points aw arded.

T h e creature must be w ithin range for the entire castin g o f the spell. (Typically, the creature is first su m m on ed into the center o f an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped w hile this spell is cast.) At the com pletion o f the casting, the target m ust m ake a C harism a saving throw. On a failed save, it is b ou n d to serve you for the duration. If the creature w as su m m on ed or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to m atch the duration o f this spell. A b ou n d creature m ust follow your instructions to the best o f its ability. You m ight com m a n d the creature to accom pa n y you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a m essa ge. T h e creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to tw ist your w ord s to achieve its ow n objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions com pletely b efore the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the sam e plane o f existence. If you are on a different plane o f existence, it returns to the place w here you bou n d it and rem ains there until the spell ends. A t H igher Levels.

CONDITIONS ALTER A CREATURE’S CAPABILITIES IN a variety o f w ays and can arise as a result o f a spell, a class feature, a m on ster’s attack, or other effect. M ost conditions, such as blinded, are im pairm ents, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is coun tered by standing up, for exam ple) or for a duration sp ecified by the effect that im p osed the condition. If multiple effects im p ose the sam e condition on a creature, each instance o f the condition has its ow n duration, but the con dition ’s effects don't get w orse. A creature either has a condition or d oesn ’t. T h e follow in g definitions sp e cify w hat h a ppen s to a crea tu re w h ile it is su bjected to a con dition .

E x h a u s t i o n Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects o f freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels o f exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. Level Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 Death If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level o f exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect o f its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. ■f P o i s o n e d • A p oison ed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

A p p e n d i x B : G o d s o f t h e M u l t i v e r s e RELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN t h e w orld s o f the D & D multiverse. W h en g od s w alk the w orld, clerics channel divine pow er, evil cults perform dark sa crifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like b e a co n s against the darkness, it’s hard to b e am bivalent about the deities and deny their existence. M any p eople in the w orlds o f D & D w orsh ip different g od s at different tim es and circu m stan ces. P eop le in the Forgotten R ealm s, for exam ple, might pray to Sune for luck in love, m ake an offering to W aukeen before headin g to the market, and pray to ap pease T alos w hen a severe storm blow s in—all in the sa m e day. M any p eople have a favorite am ong the gods, one w h o s e ideals and teach in gs they m ake their ow n. A nd a few people dedicate them selves entirely to a single god, usually servin g as a priest or cham pion o f that g o d ’s ideals. Your DM determ ines w hich gods, if any, are w orshiped in his or her cam paign. F rom am ong the gods available, you can c h o o s e a single deity for your character to serve, w orship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to m ost often. O r just m ake a mental note o f the gods w h o are revered in your D M ’s cam paign s o you can invoke their n am es w hen appropriate. If you ’re playing a cleric or a character with the A colyte background, decide w hich god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested dom ain s w hen selecting your character’s dom ain. D&D P a n t h e o n s E ach w orld in the D & D m ultiverse has its ow n pantheons o f deities, ranging in size from the teem ing pantheons o f the Forgotten R ealm s and G reyhaw k to the m ore focu sed religions o f E berron and D ragonlance. M any o f the nonhum an races w orsh ip the sam e g od s on different w orld s—M oradin, for exam ple, is revered by d w arves o f the Forgotten R ealm s, G reyhawk, and many other w orlds. T h e F o r g o t t e n R e a l m s D ozen s o f deities are revered, w orshiped, and feared throughout the w orld o f the Forgotten R ealm s. At least thirty deities are w idely kn ow n a cross the R ealm s, and m any m ore are w orsh ip ed locally, by individual tribes, sm all cults, or certain sects o f larger religious tem ples. T h e L ife a n d D e a t h D o m a i n s Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric o f any non-evil deity can choose it. A number o f other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god o f death, consult your Dungeon Master. G r e y h a w k The gods o f G reyhaw k c o m e from at least four different pantheons, representing the faiths o f the various ethnic grou ps that populated the continent o f O erik over the ages. A s a result, there’s a great deal o f overlap in their portfolios: P elor is the Flan god o f the sun and Pholtus is the O eridian sun god, for exam ple. D r a g o n l a n c e T h e g od s o f the w orld o f K rynn are three fam ilies: seven g od s o f g ood headed by Paladine and M ishakal, seven of neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven o f evil headed by Takhisis and Sargon nas. T h ese deities have been called by m any different n am es and held in varying levels o f esteem by different p eop les and cultures through the w orld ’s history, but they are the only g od s o f this w orld— their place fixed in the stars as constellations. E b e r r o n Th e w orld o f E berron has m any different religions, but the m ost im portant revolves around a pantheon called the Sovereign H ost and their m align shadow, the Dark Six. T h e g od s o f the S overeign H ost are thought to have dom inion over every aspect o f existence, and to sp eak w ith a unified voice. But the D ark S ix are the primitive, bloody, and cru el g od s w h o offer a dissen tin g voice. E b erron ’s other religions are very different from the traditional D & D pantheons. T h e m on oth eistic Church o f the Silver F lam e is devoted to fighting against evil in the w orld, but plagued by corruption in its ow n ranks. T h e ph ilosoph y o f the B lood o f Vol teach es that divinity lies w ithin all m ortal bein gs and reveres the undead w h o have secu red that im mortality. V arious m ad cults are devoted to the d em on s and h orrors im prison ed in E berron 's U nderdark (called Khyber, the D ragon Below). The follow ers o f the Path o f Light believe that the w orld is heading tow ard a glorious future w here the sh ad ow s that cloud this w orld w ill be transform ed into light. A n d tw o related nations o f elves revere their ancestral spirits: the U ndying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead form s, and the glorified Spirits o f the Past, the great h eroes o f ancient w ars. N o n h u m a n D e i t i e s Certain g od s closely associated w ith nonhum an races are revered on m any different w orlds, though not always in the sam e way. The nonhum an races o f the Forgotten R ealm s and G reyhaw k share these deities. N onhum an races often have w hole pantheons o f their ow n. B esid es M oradin, for exam ple, the dw arf g od s include M oradin’s w ife, B erron ar Truesilver, and a num ber o f other g od s thought to be their children and grandchildren: Abbathor, C langeddin Silverbeard, D ugm aren Brightm antle, D um athoin, G orm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, M artham m or Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kin gdom s o f d w arves m ight revere som e, all, or n one o f th ese deities, and som e have other g od s unkn ow n (or know n by other n am es) to outsiders.

W h en the first forester dared put a nam e to the face seen in the bole o f a tree or the v oice babbling in a brook, these g od s forced them selves into being. T h e Celtic g od s are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces o f nature that druids revere. T h e G r e e k P a n t h e o n The g od s o f O lym pus m ake them selves kn ow n with the gentle lap o f w aves against the sh ores and the crash of the thunder am ong the cloud -enshroud ed peaks. The thick boar-infested w o o d s and the sere, olive-covered h illsides hold eviden ce o f their passing. Every aspect o f nature e c h o e s w ith their p resen ce, and they’ve m ade a place for them selves inside the hum an heart, too. T h e E g y p t i a n Pa n t h e o n T h ese gods are a youn g dynasty o f an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership o f the c o s m o s and the m aintenance o f the divine principle o f M a’at—the fundam ental order o f truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, m ortal pharaohs, and ordinary m en and w om en in their logical and rightful place in the universe. T h e Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three g od s w ith the D eath dom ain o f different alignm ents. A nubis is the lawful neutral g od o f the afterlife, w ho Fa n t a s y - H i s t o r i c a l Pa n t h e o n s ju d g es the sou ls o f the dead. S et is a chaotic evil god o f murder, perhaps best kn ow n for killing his brother O siris. A nd Nephthys is a chaotic g o o d g od d ess o f m ourning. Thus, although m ost clerics o f the Death dom ain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are villainous characters, clerics w h o serve A nubis or Nephthys need not be. T h e N o r s e Pa n t h e o n W h ere the land plum m ets from the sn ow y hills into the icy fjords below , w here the lon gboats draw up on to the beach , w here the glaciers flow forw ard and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land o f the Vikings, the h om e o f the N orse pantheon. It’s a brutal clim e, and one that calls for brutal living. The w arriors o f the land have had to adapt to the harsh condition s in order to survive, but they haven’t been too tw isted by the n eed s o f their environm ent. Given the n ecessity o f raiding for food and w ealth, it’s su rprisin g the m ortals turned out as w ell as they did. T heir p ow ers reflect the n eed th ese w arriors had for stron g leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every ben d o f a river, hear them in the crash o f the thunder and the b oom in g o f the glaciers, and sm ell them in the sm ok e o f a burning lon gh ou se. T h e N orse pantheon includes tw o main fam ilies, the A esir (deities o f w ar and destiny) and the Vanir (gods o f fertility and prosperity). O nce en em ies, these tw o fam ilies are n ow closely allied against their com m on en em ies, the giants (including the g od s S urtur and Thrym ). Like the g od s o f G reyhawk, g od s in different fam ilies som etim es have overlap in their spheres o f influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and O dur (of the Aesir) are both associated w ith the sun, for exam ple.

It e n com p a sses every w orld w here D u n geon M asters run their adventures, all w ithin the relatively m undane realm o f the Material Plane. B eyond that plane are dom ains o f raw elem ental matter and energy, realm s o f pure thought and ethos, the h om es o f d em on s and angels, and the dom in ion s o f the gods. M any sp ells and m agic item s can draw energy from these planes, su m m on the creatures that dwell there, com m u n icate w ith their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. A s your character achieves greater p ow er and higher levels, you might undertake a quest to rescu e a friend from the h orrific depths o f the A byss, or find y ou rself hoisting a tankard w ith the friendly giants o f Ysgard. You m ight w alk on streets m ade o f solid fire or test your m ettle on a battlefield w h ere the fallen are resu rrected with each dawn. T h e M a t e r i a l P l a n e The M aterial Plane is the nexus w here the p h ilosoph ica l and elem ental forces that define the other p lanes collide in the ju m b led existence o f m ortal life and m undane matter. All the w orld s o f D & D exist w ithin the Material P lane, m aking it the starting point for m ost cam paigns and adventures. T h e rest o f the m ultiverse is defined in relation to the M aterial Plane. The w orld s o f the M aterial P lane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative im agination o f the DM s w h o set their gam es there, as w ell as the players w h ose h eroes adventure there. Th ey include m agic-w asted desert planets and island-dotted water w orlds, w orld s w h ere m agic com b in es w ith advanced tech n ology and others trapped in an en d less Stone Age, w orld s w here the g od s w alk and p la ces they have abandoned. The best-kn ow n w orld s in the m ultiverse are the on es that have been published as official cam paign settings for the D & D gam e over the y ea rs—Greyhawk, B lackm oor, D ragon lance, the Forgotten R ealm s, Mystara, Birthright, D ark Sun, and E berron, am ong others. E ach o f these w orld s boasts its ow n cast o f h eroic adventurers and sch em in g villains, its ow n ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its ow n du ngeon s and its ow n dragons. But if your cam paign takes place on on e o f th ese w orlds, it b elon gs to your DM —you might im agine it as one o f th ou san ds o f parallel versions o f the w orld, w hich m ight diverge w ildly from the published version. M a t e r i a l E c h o e s The M aterial Plane is a richly m agical place, and its m agical nature is reflected in the tw o planes that share its central place in the m ultiverse. T h e Feyw ild and the Sh adow fell are parallel dim en sion s occu p yin g the sam e cosm o lo g ica l space, s o they are often called e ch o planes or m irror planes to the M aterial P lane. T h e w orld s and la n dsca pes o f th ese planes m irror the natural w orld o f the M aterial Plane but reflect th ose features into different form s—m ore m arvelous and m agical in the Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadow fell. W h ere a v olca n o stands in the M aterial Plane, a m ountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that g low with internal fire tow ers in the Feywild, and a ja g g ed rock ou tcropping resem blin g a skull m arks the sp ot on the Shadow fell. T h e Feywild, also called the Plane o f Faerie, is a land o f soft lights and w onder, a country o f little p eople with great desires, a place o f m usic and death. It is a realm o f eternal twilight, w ith slow lanterns bob bin g in the gentle breeze and huge fireflies bu zzing through groves and fields. T h e sky is alight with the faded co lo rs o f the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never truly sets or rises; it rem ains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the S eelie Court, the land is a tangle o f sharp-toothed bram bles and syrupy fen s—perfect territory for the U nseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, su ch as th ose brought to the w orld by conjure woodland beings and sim ilar spells, dw ell in the Feywild. T h e Shadowfell, also called the Plane o f Shadow , is a darkly lighted dim ension, a w orld o f black and white w here c o lo r has been leach ed from everything. It is a place o f toxic dark n ess that hates the light, w here the sky is a black vault w ith neither sun nor stars. P o s i t i v e a n d N e g a t i v e P l a n e s Like a dome above the other planes, the Positive Plane is the source o f radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark reflection is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy that destroys the living and animates the undead. B e y o n d t h e M a t e r i a l B eyond the M aterial P lane, the various planes of existence are realm s o f myth and mystery. T h ey ’re not sim ply other w orlds, but different qualities o f being, form ed and governed by spiritual and elem ental principles abstracted from the ordinary w orld. P l a n a r T r a v e l W h en adventurers travel into other planes o f existence, they are undertaking a legendary jou rn ey a cross the thresholds o f existence to a m ythic destination w here they strive to com plete their quest. S u ch a jou rn ey is the stuff o f legend. Braving the realm s o f the dead, seeking out the celestial servants o f a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its h om e city w ill be the su bject o f son g and story for years to com e. Travel to the planes beyon d the M aterial Plane can be accom p lish ed in tw o w ays: by castin g a spell or by using a planar portal. Spells. A n um ber o f spells allow direct or indirect a c c e s s to other planes o f existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane o f existence, w ith different deg rees o f precision. Etherealness allow s adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any o f the planes it tou ch es—the Shadow fell, the Feywild, or the Elem ental Planes. A nd the astral projection spell lets adventurers project them selves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes. Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar con n ection that links a sp ecific location on on e plane to a sp ecific location on another. S om e portals are like doorw ays, a clear w indow , or a fog- sh rouded passage, and sim ply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. O thers are loca tion s— circles o f standing stones, soa rin g tow ers, sailing ships, or even w hole tow n s—that exist in multiple planes at o n ce or flicker from on e plane to another in turn. S om e are vortices, typically join in g an Elem ental Plane w ith a very sim ilar location on the M aterial Plane, such as the heart o f a v olca n o (leading to the Plane o f Fire) or the depths o f the o ce a n (to the Plane o f Water). T r a n s i t i v e P l a n e s The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. Th ey are m ostly featureless realm s that serve prim arily as w ays to travel from on e plane to another. S p ells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond. The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bou nd dim ension that is som etim es d escrib ed as a great ocean . Its shores, called the B order Ethereal, overlap the M aterial Plane and the Inner Planes, s o that every location on those planes has a corresp on d in g location on the Ethereal P lane. Certain creatu res can see into the B order Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. S o m e m agical effects a lso extend from the M aterial Plane into the B order Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall o f force. The depths o f the plane, the D eep Ethereal, are a region o f sw irling m ists and colorfu l fogs. The Astral Plane is the realm o f thought and dream , w here visitors travel as disem b od ied sou ls to reach the planes o f the divine and dem onic. It is a great, silvery sea, the sam e above and below , w ith sw irling w isp s o f white and gray streaking am ong m otes o f light resem blin g distant stars. Erratic w h irlpools o f color flicker in m idair like spinning coin s. O ccasion al bits o f solid m atter can be found here, but m ost o f the Astral Plane is an endless, op en dom ain. I n n e r P l a n e s The Inner P la n es su rrou nd and enfold the Material Plane and its ech oes, providing the raw elem ental su bstance from w hich all the w orld s w ere m ade. The four Elemental P lanes—Air, Earth, Fire, and W ater— form a ring around the M aterial P lane, su spended w ithin the churning Elemental Chaos. At their in nerm ost edges, w here they are closest to the M aterial Plane (in a con ceptu al if not a literal geograph ical sense), the four Elem ental P lanes resem ble a w orld in the M aterial Plane. T h e four elem ents m ingle together as they do in the Material Plane, form in g land, sea, and sky. Farther from the M aterial Plane, though, the E lem ental P la n es are both alien and hostile. Here, the elem ents exist in their purest form —great expan ses o f solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. T h ese region s are little-known, so w hen d iscu ssin g the P la n e o f Fire, for exam ple, a speak er usually m eans just the border region. At the farthest extents o f the Inner Planes, the pure elem ents dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult o f clashing en ergies and colliding substance, the E lem ental Chaos. O u t e r P l a n e s If the Inner P la n es are the raw m atter and en ergy that m akes up the m ultiverse, the Outer P la n es are the direction, thought and p u rp ose for such construction. A ccordingly, m any sa ges refer to the Outer P la n es as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer P la n es are best kn ow n as the h om es o f deities. W h en d iscu ssin g anything to do with deities, the language u sed m ust be highly m etaphorical. Their actual h om es are not literally “p la ces” at all, but exem plify the idea that the Outer P la n es are realm s o f thought and spirit. A s w ith the E lem ental P lanes, one can im agine the perceptible part o f the Outer P la n es as a sort o f border region, w hile extensive spiritual region s lie beyond ordinary s en sory experience. Even in th ose perceptible regions, ap pearan ces can be deceptive. Initially, m any o f the Outer P la n es appear hospitable and fam iliar to natives o f the M aterial Plane. But the lan dscape can change at the w h im s o f the pow erfu l forces that live on the Outer P lanes. T h e desires o f the m ighty forces that dw ell on these planes can rem ake them com pletely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their ow n needs. D istan ce is a virtually m ean in gless con cep t on the Outer Planes. T h e perceptible region s o f the planes often seem quite sm all, but they ca n also stretch on to w hat seem s like infinity. It m ight be p ossib le to take a guided tour o f the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day—if the p ow ers o f the Hells desire it. Or it cou ld take w eek s for travelers to m ake a grueling trek a cross a single layer. T h e m ost w ell-know n Outer P la n es are a group of sixteen planes that c orresp on d to the eight alignm ents (excluding neutrality) and the sh ades o f distinction b etw een them. O u t e r P l a n e s Outer Plane Alignment Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens o f LG Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of NG, LG Elysium, the Blessed Fields of NG The Beastlands, the Wilderness of NG, CG Arborea, the Olympian Glades of CG Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of CN, CG Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of CN Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths of CN, CE The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of CE Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of NE, CE Hades, the Gray Waste of NE Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity o f NE, LE The Nine Hells ( o f Baator) LE Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of LN, LE Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of LN Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of LN, LG T h e planes w ith som e elem ent o f g o o d in their nature are called the Upper Planes. C elestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dw ell in the U pper Planes. P lanes w ith som e elem ent o f evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends such as dem ons, devils, and y ugoloth s dw ell in the L ow er P lanes. A plane’s alignm ent is its essen ce, and a character w h o s e alignm ent d oesn ’t match the plane’s e x p erien ces a profound sen se o f d isson a n ce there. W h en a g o o d creature visits Elysium , for exam ple, it feels in tune w ith the plane, but an evil creature feels out o f tune and m ore than a little uncom fortable. O t h e r P l a n e s Existing som eh ow b etw een or beyon d the kn ow n planes o f existen ce are a variety o f other realm s. S i g i l a n d t h e O u t l a n d s T h e Outlands is the plane betw een the Outer Planes, a plane o f neutrality, but not the neutrality o f nothingness. Instead it in corporates a little o f everything, keeping it all in a paradoxical ba la n ce—sim ultaneously concordan t and in opposition. It is a broad region o f varied terrain, w ith open prairies, tow ering m ountains, and twisting, shallow rivers, strongly resem blin g an ordinary w orld o f the Material Plane. The O utlands is circular, like a great w h eel—in fact, th ose w h o envision the Outer P la n es as a w h eel point to the O utlands as proof, calling it a m icr o co s m o f the planes. That argum ent might be circular, however, for it is p ossib le that the arrangem ent o f the O utlands inspired the idea o f the Great W h eel in the first place. A rou n d the outside edge o f the circle, evenly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlem ents, each built around a portal leading to one o f the Outer Planes. Each tow n sh ares m any o f the characteristics o f the plane w here its gate leads. At the center o f the Outlands, like the axle o f the planar w heel, the S p ire sh oots im possibly high into the sky. A bove this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city o f Sigil, the City o f D oors. This bustling planar m etropolis h olds cou n tless portals to other p lanes and w orlds. Sigil is a trader’s city. G ood s, m erchandise, and inform ation co m e to it from a cross the planes. T here is a brisk trade in inform ation about the planes, in particular in the com m a n d w ord s or item s requ ired for the operation o f particular portals. T h ese portal keys are highly sought after, and m any travelers w ithin the city are look in g for a particular p ortal or a portal key to allow them to continue on their way. D e m i p l a n e s D em iplan es are sm all extradim ensional sp a ces with their ow n unique rules. They are p ieces o f reality that don ’t seem to fit anyw here else. D em iplan es com e into being by a variety o f m eans. S o m e are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire o f a p ow erfu l deity or other force. Th ey m ay exist naturally, as a fold o f existing reality that has been pin ched off from the rest o f the multiverse, or as a baby universe grow in g in pow er. A given dem iplane can be entered through a single point w here it tou ch es another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a dem iplane, but the proper frequ ency required for the tuning fork is extrem ely hard to acquire. The gate sp ell is m ore reliable, assu m in g the caster k n ow s o f the dem iplane. T h e Fa r R e a l m T h e Far R ea lm is beyon d the kn ow n m ultiverse. In fact, it might b e an entirely separate m ultiverse w ith its ow n physical and m agical laws. W h ere stray en ergies from the Far R ealm leak onto another plane, life and matter are w arp ed and tw isted into alien sh apes that defy ordinary geom etry and biology.

A p p e n d i x E: I n s p i r a t i o n a l R e a d i n g INSPIRATION FOR ALL OF THE FANTASY WORK I HAVE done stems directly from the love m y father showed when I was a lad, for he spent many hours telling me stories he made up as he went along, tales o f cloaked old men who could grant wishes, o f magic rings and enchanted swords, or wicked sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen. . .. All o f us tend to get ample helpings o f fantasy when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang. This often leads to reading books o f mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation o f compilations o f the myths o f various lands and peoples. Upon such a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader o f all science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950. The following authors were o f particular inspiration to me. —E.
