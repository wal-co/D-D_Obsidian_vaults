## Moving on Your Turn

- You may move a distance up to your [[speed\|speed]]
	- You do not have to move your full speed
- #Climbing, #Jumping, and #Swimming are allowed, however these follow the same rules as while #adventuring

## Breaking up your move

- You can split your movement with an [[Players Handbook/Combat/Actions in Combat\|Action]]
	- If your speed is 30 you can
		1. Move 10 feet
		2. Take an action
		3. Move the remaining 20 feet

## Difficult Terrain

- Combat often takes place in complex environments, not pristine battle arenas. Parts of the battle field may be harder to navigate for one reason or another
- Every foot of movement over #Difficult_Terrain costs an extra foot.

## Being Prone

- There are many reasons an adventure may find themselves on the ground during combat. This is known as being #prone 
	- You can drop to prone with no real effort
	- You can be knocked prone, which will likely hurt from #Falling 
	- You will fall prone if your hp drops to zero
- While prone you are #Crawling 
- Standing up takes half your speed

## Moving Around Others

- Moving through nonhostile creatures is freely
- You may only move through hostile creatures space if they are two #sizes larger or smaller than you
- You may not end you may not end your turn in the same space as another creature
- Moving out of a hostile creature's range may provoke a #opportunity_attack

## Flying

- Flying Creatures have increased mobility but are in danger of #Falling if their speed is reduced to 0.

## Creature Size

#sizes 

| Size       | Space(ft)       |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Tiny       | 2.5x2.5         |
| Small      | 5x5             |
| Medium     | 5x5             |
| Large      | 10x10           |
| Huge       | 15x15           |
| Gargantuan | 20X20 or larger |

A creature's space is not their literal size, but the area they control in combat.
