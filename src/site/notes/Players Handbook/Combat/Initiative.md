- #dice At the start of combat we will roll a [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]] check to determine the order of combat from highest to lowest
	- In the case of a tie we will roll a d20 to determine who goes first
- Initiative will be made public at the start of combat unless the players are #surprised, in which case players will determine initiative through the natural flow of combat
