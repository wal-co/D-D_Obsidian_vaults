The actions listed here are available to all characters regardless of class or race. Your class or race may provide additional options. 

Most of the time you will only get one action per turn.

Any actions not described here or on your character are up to the DM's discretion.

## Attack

Attacking is the most common action you will take. The handbook goes much more in depth, but this is the key things to know.

1. **Choose a target**
	- You must be in range of the target
		- Melee is typically **5 ft**
		- Range and spells will be noted on the weapon or spell being used
			- When using range in close combat (within 5 ft) you will have #disadvantage
2. **Determine modifiers**
	- Melee is typically [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Strength Ability Score\|STR]]
	- Range is typically [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]]
	- Some spells will require an attack roll and add the appropriate modifier
3. **Resolve the attack**
	- Roll a d20 and add modifiers to determine if you hit the target by beating their *Armor Class(AC)*
	- Roll damage on a successful hit
	- An attempted attack will reveal your location regardless of whether it hits or not, thus taking you out of hiding

```ad-info
title: Critical Rolls
collapse: open
Rolling a 1 will cause you to miss regardless of any modifiers. We can also play with the rule that it causes some other disadvantage, but I will leave that up to the party.

Rolling a 20 will cause you to hit, as well as trigger a critical hit.
```

## Cast a Spell

Spellcasters have a wide array of spells available to them. Not all of these spells will require the use of an action, but some will.

## Dash

Dashing allows you to move an additional amount up to your base speed.

An increase to your base speed changes this amount, but modifiers do not.

## Disengage

If moving past a hostile creature would provoke an opportunity attack you may instead choose to spend an action to avoid the attack.

## Dodge

When dodging any attacks made against you will be made with #disadvantage, and you will make a [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]] saving throw with #advantage 

## Help

You can lend a hand to another member of your party, allowing them to roll with #advantage on their next turn, provided they take their next turn before you.

## Hide

You can hide by making a [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]]([[Stealth\|Stealth]]) check. If you succeed you will be hidden from enemies.

## Ready

You can describe an action you will take as a [[Reactions\|Reaction]] based on another creature's turn. You will describe the trigger, and if that trigger happens, your reaction will trigger.

## Search

You can try to find something in the midst of combat by taking the search action and making a [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Wisdom Ability Score\|WIS]] or [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Intelligence Ability Score\|INT]] check.

## Use an Object

Drawing your sword, drinking a healing potion, any sort of interaction with an object requires an action. Some objects will allow you to use this action multiple times.
