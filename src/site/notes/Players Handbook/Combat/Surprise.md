# Surprise

- Before combat begins, the DM will determine if any creatures are #surprised 

- If neither side is attempting [[Stealth\|Stealth]], they automatically notice each other
- Otherwise, a single [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|DEX]] (Stealth) check is made against each creature's passive [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Wisdom Ability Score\|Wisdom]]
