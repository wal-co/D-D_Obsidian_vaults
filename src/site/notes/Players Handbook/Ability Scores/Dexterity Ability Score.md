# Dexterity (DEX)

- Measures agility, reflexes, and balance
- Skill Checks related to nimble or stealthy movement, or to keep from falling of tricky footing

## Influences

- [[Acrobatics D&D 5e \| Acrobatics]]
	- Attempt to stay on your feet
	- Stunts such as dives, rolls, flips, etc
- [[Sleight of Hand D&D  5e \| Sleight of Hand]]
	- Stealing/pick pocketing
	- Concealing items on your person
	- Planting a note in some secret place
- [[Stealth D&D 5e \| Stealth]]
	- Hide from enemies
	- Sneak away without being detected
	- Sneak up on someone

## Armor Class (AC)

- Certain armor will add some or all of your Dex modifier to your AC

## Initiative

- A Dex check will be made at the start of any combat to determine turn order

## Hiding
- Ultimately the DM decides whether or not conditions are right for hiding.<br>For example, you cannot hide while a creature can clearly see you, but you may be able to hide if another player draws their attention and you want to try to hide in a tree. The DM will decide if the other player sufficiently drew attention.
- A Dex ([[Stealth\|Stealth]]) check will be made, and creatures actively searching for you will need to make a [[Wisdom Ability Score \| Wisdom check]] that is ≥ to the rolled check.
- Invisible creatures can always try to hide, but they do need to stay quiet and signs of their passage will be noticeable (ex. footprints in mud)
- In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

## Passive Perception
$$
\text{Wisdom Modifier}+10
$$
- A creature's general awareness of their surroundings
	- This is so you do not have to ask things like "What color is the sky", that is pretty obvious (as long as you can see).
- A target's passive perception greater than your stealth roll will cause that roll to fail no matter what
```ad-important
Advantage adds 5 to passive perception

```

## Environmental Effects

- A general rule of thumb is to think about lighting in an area when determining what you may be able to perceive. Remember, ultimately the DM will decide if you have the ability to perceive something, but your perception rolls will be the actual determining factor beyond passive perception.
- Players with [[Dark Vision\|Dark Vision]] will be able to perceive things in low light better than those that do not have it.
