collapse: open
A perception check will be made when you are actively trying to look for something that your passive perception cannot see. 

For example, your passive perception may let you know a bookshelf is in the room, but in order to see if any of the books seem out of place I may ask for a Perception Check. Your success on that roll may reveal that you see one of the books juts out a little further like there may be something behind it
