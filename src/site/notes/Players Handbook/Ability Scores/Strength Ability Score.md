	- attempt to lift, push, or pull something
	- attempt to force your body through a space (breaking it)
	- apply brute force to a situation

## Lifting and Carrying
### Carrying Capacity
$$\text{carrying capacity}=\text{strength}\cdot{15}$$
- Weight in pounds you can carry. Most characters should not need to worry about this because it *should* be a high number

### Push, Drag, or Lift
$$
\text{weight}=\text{carrying capacity}\cdot{2}
$$
```ad-caution
When pushing or dragging weight greater than your ability, your speed drops to 5 feet

```

### Size and Strength
- Larger creatures can bear more weight
	- For each [[D&D Size Category 5e \| size category]]
		- above medium <- double the carrying capacity
		- tiny <-- double the carrying capacity
