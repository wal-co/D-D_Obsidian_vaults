# Races

- The world of Dungeons and Dragons is full of many different races. There are complex dynamics between general races, and you *may* encounter other people in the world that respond to your race in certain ways. You can generally assume the world to be accepting in most cases though.
- Your race determines the [[Hit Die\|Hit Die]] rolled when creating your [[Players Handbook/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] as well
