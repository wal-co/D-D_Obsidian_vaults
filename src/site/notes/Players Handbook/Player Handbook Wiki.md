```ad-info
title: Critical Rolls
collapse: open
A #dice roll of a 1 or 20 on a d20 is known as a crit fail or crit success respectively. These can lead to either devestating consequences or incredible feats, and are a good source of #Inspiration if you role play them out effectively!
```


## Other dice rules to note:
>1. Specific beats general
>	If you have a class/race trait, magic weapon, etc, that changes a general rule, it wins
>2. Round down
>	If ever you need to divide a dice roll for any reason, round down for odd numbers.
>	ie:
$$
\frac{19}{2}=9.5≈9≠10

# Using Ability Scores

- #Ability_Score - Determines your capability in different areas
- #Modifier - The value you add when rolling a skill check
- #Proficiency - #class or #race bonus added to specific ability checks
	- Ex: When picking a lock, a #rogue with #Proficiency in lock smithing tools would add that value.
## Categories

- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Strength Ability Score\|Strength]], measuring physical power
- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Dexterity Ability Score\|Dexterity]], measuring agility
- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Constitution Ability Score\|Constitution]], measuring endurance
- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Intelligence Ability Score\|Intelligence]], measuring reasoning and memory
- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Wisdom Ability Score\|Wisdom]], measuring perception and insight
- [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Charisma Ability Score\|Charisma]], measuring force of personality

Each creature and character has a number that defines the magnitude of that ability.
- 10 or 11 is considered the normal human average
- 20 is the highest score possible for adventurers 
- 30 is the highest score possible for monsters and divine beings

## Modifier 

| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
|   1   |    -5    |
|  2-3  |    -4    |
|  4-5  |    -3    |

| 26-27 |    +8    |
| 28-29 |    +9    |
|  30   |   +10    |


## Proficiency Bonus

- Determined by level
- Bonuses are only added once, even if multiple rules tell you to add it

## Ability Checks

- #dice Ability checks are a core mechanic of the game
- Represents the difficulty of the task and the trait used to complete it
- Ability checks are made with a d20 and the modifiers are applied

|  Task Difficulty  | DC  |
|:-----------------:|:---:|
|     Very easy     |  5  |
|       Easy        | 10  |
|      Medium       | 15  |
|       Hard        | 20  |
|     Very hard     | 25  |
| Nearly impossible | 30    |

```ad-info
title: Specific Skills
Each category has skills related to it that your character may be proficient in. I will either ask for a specific proficiency or a general category.

You may ask to use proficiency in a skill on your check and I will decide if you can add the proficiency or not.

There are certain circumstances where a desired action could be solved with different checks. For example, trying to outrun an enemy could use a CON(Athletics) to see if you can run longer, but it may also be a STR(Athletics) check to see if you can run faster.

```

## Passive Checks

- Checks that do not require a dice roll
	- Repetitive or simple tasks
- Checks that are hidden
	- I may ask for your passive perception to determine what you can see when you enter a room
	- I may ask for your Dexterity Modifier to determine who's footing is stable enough to easily move about on a ship in the middle of a storm 
	
 - [[Hiding\|Hiding]] involves you beating the targets passive checks

$$
\text{Passive} = 10 + \text{modifiers}
$$

## Working Together

- Players may ask for help from others on tasks, if I allow help then you will roll with advantage
	- In combat this requires the Help action^[See [[Players Handbook/Player Handbook Wiki#Combat\|#Combat]]]
	- The character providing help must be able to attempt the task alone
	- Some tasks are not easier with help
- Group checks require at least half the group to succeed the check in order for the whole group to succeed

# Adventuring

#adventuring 

- Follows the core flow of the game
	1. The DM describes the environment
	2. The players describe what they want to do
	3. Th DM narrates the results of their actions

## Time

- The DM determines [[Players Handbook/Adventuring/Time\|Time]]

- A #time table can be referenced below

| Scenario | Interval |
| -------- | -------- |
| Dungeon  | minutes  |
| Wild     | Hours    |
| City     | Hours    |
| Journeys | Days     |
| Combat   | Seconds         |

## Movement

- [[Movement\|Movement]] can either be general or specific depending on what the adventurers are doing
- Speed is the distance you can walk in 1 unit of time
	- Travelers can move at a slow, normal, or fast pace
	- Players generally travel 8 hours in a day at their set pace, but there are exceptions
		- Forced March allows for travelers to travel longer, but at a risk
			- $\text{saving throw}=\text{DC}+1\text{ per hour past 8}$
		- Mounts can be ridden for 1 hour at double your speed
		- Vehicles can extend the time you can travel, some up to 24 hours per day
	- Difficult terrain (such as deep swamps or crumbling ruins) will cut your speed in half
- Adventuring often requires moving through difficult Terrain
	- #Climbing, #Swimming, and #Crawling costs 1 extra foot
	- #Jumping is determined by [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Strength Ability Score\|STR]]
- When traveling the DM will determine a marching order
- While traveling at a slow pace travelers can move with stealth
- While traveling at a fast pace travelers get a -5 to passive perception 

## Other Adventuring Activities

- Players engaged in other activities are not watching for danger
	- Navigate
	- Make a Map
	- Track other creatures
	- Forage for supplies

## The Environment 

- Falling
	- $\text{damage}=1d6\text{ per }10ft$
	- Max of $20d6$
- Suffocating
	- Players can hold their breath
		- $\text{time}=1+\text{CON}$ 
	- After running out of breath you can survive for the number of turns equal to your [[Players Handbook/Ability Scores/Constitution Ability Score\|CON]] modifier




# Combat

While out adventuring you are likely to encounter hostile factions, waring tribes, or gangs of bandits, just to give a few examples. Combat has a clear structure where the players control their own character and the DM controls all others, both friendly and hostile.

```ad-tip
title: The DM and Combat
collapse: closed
It is never my intention to kill players, however I am also more than willing to let you suffer the consequences of your own actions. One of my favorite deaths was a Halfling Pocket-Cleric (I was small enough to ride in a pouch on the back of our barbarian to constantly heal him in battle) who died when the barbarian was engulfed in a fireball. My DM warned me that I could see a lot of magic users before I got on the barbarians back, but I chose to any ways, so when the rolls didn't go my way, it was my fault, not the DM's.

My rolls are *typically* done behind a screen, primarily because some rolls are meant to be kept secret. For potentially life altering rolls, I will make them in the open. You may also ask for a roll to be public, but I may choose to deny that request for a story reason.

```

1. [[Players Handbook/Combat/Surprise\|Surprise]]
2. The order of turns is determined by [[Players Handbook/Combat/Initiative\|Initiative]]
3. You describe your turn
	1. [[Players Handbook/Combat/Movement and Position\|Movement and Position]]
	2. [[Players Handbook/Combat/Actions in Combat\|Actions in Combat]]
4. [[Players Handbook/Combat/Damage and Healing\|Damage and Healing]]

```ad-question
title: How Do Enemies work?
collapse: open
Enemy actions will be run by the DM and follow (most) of the same rules as players. I have provided an [[Example Creature]] for you to see what I see.

```
