# Classes

- A class sets up what your character can do.
	- Classes shape the way you think about and interact with the World
	- Ex: A Fighter may view themselves as a pawn in a larger machine due to their background as a Knight, whereas a Rogue may have more of a "dog-eat-dog" mentality due to their background as a street urchin 

## List of Classes 

I have made reference pages with an annotation to the page in the Player's Handbook. There is a lot of information about classes, a lot of which deals with *how* level ups work and different powers. Do not get overwhelmed, you will get more comfortable with your class as you use it and can make notes on these pages.
