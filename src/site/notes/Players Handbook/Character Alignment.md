# Alignment

Your Alignment is a rule that describes your character (or any creature's) moral and ethical outlook on the world around them. Your actions can change your alignment, and thus have implications on your character.

```ad-important
title: Philosophy on Alignment
collapse: open
Alignment rules vary between editions and are often a point of contention between players. 

As a DM, I believe it is important to remember that you are playing with other actual people, and their "alignment" in real life is more important than your character's alignment.

***Do not do something just to spite another player and claim it matches your alignment.*** There is room in D&D campaigns to have two characters squabble with one another, but should never cross between game and reality. If you want to do something that may lead to a real argument, please talk to me and we can see how we can work it into the campaign. For this reason, I am *unlikely* to allow you to play an evil character, though we can discuss a **Lawful Evil** character if you have a good idea.

```ad-warning
title: Changing Alignment
collapse: open
I will never force an alignment change on you, however I may warn you that doing an action would go against your alignment. You may still do the action, and it may have consequences, though you may ask what those consequences could entail before doing the act. This should be rare.

You may instead realize that over the course of the campaign your character has seen things that change their outlook on the world. This type of character intraspection can make a character feel more real and more personal.
