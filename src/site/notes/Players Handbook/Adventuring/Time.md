- The DM determines the time it takes to do a task
- There are general guidelines on timespans to keep in mind
	- In #Dungeons #time takes place in minutes
	- In the #Wild or the #City, #time takes place in hours
	- For a long #Journey #time takes place in days
	- In #combat #time takes place in rounds ^[see [[Combat\|Combat]]]
